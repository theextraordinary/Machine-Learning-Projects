Most of these schools are run by publicly-traded companies, which means the profits they earn after running schools with taxpayer funds go toward paying their shareholders. These schools enroll less than 1% of American public school students right now, but the share is growing.  In their ads, these schools promise autonomy and flexibility. They appeal to students eager to escape bullies or classrooms where they feel unsuccessful. But the data show that attending these schools sets kids back academically— by a lot. And despite their poor performance, states have been slow to close these schools down.\n\nReading list: \n\nArianna Prothero and Maya Riser-Kositsky calculated the lobbying and campaign spending totals for K12 and Connections Academy for Education Week/edweek.org: https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/11/03/outsized-influence-online-charters-bring-lobbying-a.html\n\nThis 2015 study from the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford University is the most comprehensive nationwide look at online charters to date. Researchers there found that attending an online charter school for a year is equivalent to missing 180 days of instruction in math, and 72 days of instruction in reading: https://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/OnlineCharterStudyFinal2015.pdf\n\nJune Ahn (NYU) and Andrew McEachin (RAND) did a similar study of Ohio’s online charter schools and got similar results. They found that even high-achieving students who attending online charters in that state ended the year significantly behind their peers in brick-and-mortar schools: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X17692999\n\nThanks to folks at the National Education Policy Center for sharing their data on online charter enrollment from 2011 through 2016. Check out their 2017 report on the state of virtual schools to learn more: http://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/virtual-schools-annual-2017\n\nHere are more detailed responses regarding the results of the 2015 Stanford University  from K12: http://www.k12.com/response-to-nepc.html and Connections Academy:  https://www.connectionsacademy.com/news/ce-statement-virtual-charter-school-study\n\nHere's the analysis from Gary Miron and his NEPC colleague Bruce Baker of profit margins for for-profit charter operators: http://nepc.colorado.edu/files/rb_baker-miron_charter_revenue_0.pdf\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

3D_ZODCSKXo,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Wednesday, January 17th, 2018) Mark Ellis, Jay Washington, Jon Schnepp, Kristian Harloff discuss the following:\n\n1) Flash’ Standalone Film Taps Directors John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein\n\n2) First Official Synopsis for ‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’ Teases an Eventful Adventure\n\n3) First Trailer for Gus Van Sant’s: ‘Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot’ starring Joaquin Phoenix, Jack Black and Jonah Hill\n\n4) New ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp’ Image Shows Off the Title Team, All Suited Up\n\n5) New trailer released for Love, Simon\n\n6) Mail Bag \n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nVariety is reporting that the Vacation helmers John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein are in negotiations to direct Flashpoint, the Flash’s standalone feature starring Ezra Miller. Interestingly enough, the studio initially asked Ben Affleck to return to the director’s chair, but he eventually passed. This comes as Warner Bros. begins reshuffling its D.C. properties, with New Line exec Walter Hamada recently promoted to oversee its comic book movies. \n\nDisney has released the first official synopsis for Solo: A Star Wars Story, the major new Star Wars movie that’s coming out in a little over four months. As part of Disney’s 2018 preview kit, the synopsis seems to tease the release of the first trailer, which should be coming any day now.\n\nAGREE OR DISAGREE\n\nAmazon Studios has released the first trailer for Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot. Written and directed by Gus Van Sant, the film is based on the memoir of the same name by cartoonist, artist, and musician John Callahan. Joaquin Phoenix plays Callahan, who becomes a quadriplegic in a car accident at the age of 21 after a day of drinking. \n\nYesterday, Disney released its 2018 preview kit teasing their upcoming slate of films and inside featured the first official look at Hope Van Dyne alongside Scott Lang in Marvel’s upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly reprise their roles in the movie alongside Michael Peña and Michael Douglas, that will also introduce Hope’s mother, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. \n\n20th Century Fox has released a new trailer for Love, Simon. Based on Becky Albertalli’s novel, Greg Berlanti’s film follows seventeen-year-old Simon Spier (Nick Robinson), who is currently grappling with how to tell his family and friends that he’s gay while also working to identify an anonymous classmate he’s fallen for online. The film is set for release on March 16th. \n\nMAIL BAG \n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Jay: https://twitter.com/MrJayWashington\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

JrFiNSueT3Y,"More Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nFirst and foremost, our hats go off to Mr. Morgan Freeman also known as the man I hope to narrate my life story one day. He was honored tonight with the Lifetime Achievement Award. \nMorgan’s good friend, Rita Moreno presented him with the prestigious award and the display of their friendship was beyond adorable. Morgan was sure to thank her along with his family and friends who flew out to celebrate with him as well as his peers in the room. Then Morgan took a moment to point out the fact that the SAG award statue, known as the Actor has a bit of a bias to it. \nYou gotta love Morgan Freeman. Another person you can’t help but to love is Sterling K. Brown. He won best male actor in a drama series for his role on This Is Us making history once again becoming the first black man to win in that category. \nSterling also thanked his peers in the room and his beautiful wife who had the sweetest most adorable reaction to his winning streak continuing.  \nWhen the camera panned to Ryan’s face while Sterling was giving his speech, she was literally shaking with pride and happiness. \nWhich brings me to yet another moving moment during the show. Nicole Kidman won her first SAG award tonight for best Female Actor in a television Movie or Limited Series for her work  in Big Little Lies. She got choked up noting that winning means so much to her because she has been acting since she was 14 years old. \nShe went on to thank her co-stars, fellow nominees and female actors who have inspired her and paved the way for her career. \nShe continued saying - We've proven — and these actresses and so many more have proven — we are potent and powerful and viable. I just beg that the industry stays behind us because our stories are finally being told. It's only the beginning.\n\n\nFor More Clevver Visit:\nThere are 2 types of people: those who follow us on Facebook and those who are missing out http://facebook.com/clevver\n\nKeep up with us on Instagram: http://instagr.am/Clevver\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ClevverTV\nWebsite: http://www.clevver.com \n\n\nAdd us to your circles on Google+: http://google.com/+ClevverNews\nTweet Me: http://www.twitter.com/Drew__dorsey"

P2I7hQHOqNI,"Martin Luther King - A Time to Break Silence\nStarting in 1965, King began to express doubts about the United States' role in the Vietnam War. In an April 4, 1967, appearance at the New York City Riverside Church — exactly one year before his death — King delivered Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence. In the speech he spoke strongly against the U.S.'s role in the war, insisting that the U.S. was in Vietnam to occupy it as an American colony and calling the U.S. government the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.\nNow, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for the integrity and life of America today can ignore the present war. If America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read: Vietnam. It can never be saved so long as it destroys the deepest hopes of men the world over. So it is that those of us who are yet determined that America will be are led down the path of protest and dissent, working for the health of our land.\nAt this point I should make it clear that while I have tried in these last few minutes to give a voice to the voiceless in Vietnam and to understand the arguments of those who are called enemy, I am as deeply concerned about our own troops there as anything else. For it occurs to me that what we are submitting them to in Vietnam is not simply the brutalizing process that goes on in any war where armies face each other and seek to destroy. We are adding cynicism to the process of death, for they must know after a short period there that none of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved. Before long they must know that their government has sent them into a struggle among Vietnamese, and the more sophisticated surely realize that we are on the side of the wealthy, and the secure, while we create a hell for the poor.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. (January 15, 1929 -- April 4, 1968), was one of the main leaders of the American civil rights movement. A Baptist minister by training, King became a civil rights activist early in his career, leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott and helping to found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. His efforts led to the 1963 March on Washington, where King delivered his I Have a Dream speech, raising public consciousness of the civil rights movement and establishing King as one of the greatest orators in American history. In 1964, King became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end segregation and racial discrimination through civil disobedience and other non-violent means.\n\nDr. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Martin Luther King Day was established as a national holiday in the United States in 1986. In 2004, King was posthumously awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.\nMartin Luther King - A Time to Break Silence\nMartin Luther King - A Time to Break Silence - Vietnam MLK Iraq\nMartin Luther King - A Time to Break Silence MLK Vietnam Iraq"

76LcOD4aY-o,"WHITE PINE, Tenn. - An adorable Nativity scene in an East Tennessee church took a hilarious turn when the little girl playing a sheep decided to play with baby Jesus.\n\nAt the First Baptist Church of White Pine, the kids of their live Nativity scene stole the show, but not for the reason you may think.\n\nWhile the children's choir sang Away In A Manger the scene began to unravel. \n\nThe sheep, played by Tana Benson's little girl, Teegan, got up, took baby Jesus out of the manger and began to play with the doll on stage.\n\nLaughter could be heard from parents and audience members as she continued to play and dance with the doll.\n\nYet, it wasn't until the little girl playing Mary decided to take matters into her own hands and take the doll back.\n\nShe and the sheep struggled for a brief moment, before Mary was able to get the doll back in the manger.\n\nBenson said in her Facebook post, that has since gone viral, that she laughed until she cried."

It was back in 2016 when Lionsgate hired Hamilton star and creator Lin-Manuel Miranda to serve as a creative producer and musical mastermind on the feature film and TV series adaptations, along with Rothfuss. \n\nAccording to Variety, TriStar Pictures has landed worldwide distribution rights to the Mr. Rogers biopic “You Are My Friend,” with Tom Hanks attached to play Mr. Rogers. Diary of a Teenage Girl director Marielle Heller is helming the pic from a script by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster. The film is inspired by a real-life friendship between Fred Rogers and award-winning journalist Tom Junod. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nBleecker Street has released the first trailer for Unsane, a horror movie shot entirely on an iPhone by director Steven Soderbergh. The story follows a woman who’s convinced she sees her stalker everywhere, and who inadvertently admits herself to a psych ward. \n\nLionsgate has debuted the first trailer for Submergence, the romantic drama from Wings of Desire and Paris, Texas filmmaker Wim Wenders. Based on J.M.

I decided to drop out of college to spend time experiencing our bucket list together.\n\nWe are actively looking for a Bone Marrow donor to help Chris win this fight, his last hope to defeat cancer once again.\n\nMy Best Friend is the story of Chris' life. Join us in our journey to document, experience, and inspire all of the amazing things that make life worth living. \n\nChris Betancourt, 19.\n\nChris was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina but moved to California with his Sister, Mom, and Dad around the age of 10. Entering a new school in a completely new state, Chris was nervous. Fortunately, he was able to meet a few life-long friends like Dillon and Vincent, who shared a mutual interest for video games.\n\nChris' life would take a dramatic turn in 5th grade. On Memorial Day, 2009 he would be rushed to the hospital after passing out at the beach. After staying in the ER for 13 hours, Chris was transported to Kaiser Roseville before being officially diagnosed with Chronic Mylogenous Leukemia. After many experimental treatments and a few miserable months in the hospital, Chris was well on the road to recovery and eventually entered remission.\n\nIn Sophomore year of high school, Chris faced another life-altering experience. On the morning of May 4th, 2014 Chris woke up the news that his sister had taken her own life. After many years of emotional chaos caused by such a loss, Chris was able continue life with his head up. He continues to be the happiest person in any room he enters. \n\nAfter successfully graduating from Del Campo Highschool, Chris began setting up his future. Before entering college, he took a year off to work as an electrician and save up money. At this point his father had moved to Florida, his mother to Puerto Rico. Eventually, Chris would be enrolled as a full time student at Sacramento City College where he prepared for his future as an IT professional.\n\nOn September 2nd, 2017 Chris sat down to hear the worst news possible. The cancer cells in his blood jumped from .001% to 11% and had officially returned. This time, the cancer was a new mutated string that is resilient to most of the experimental drugs he had used before. Though difficult to acknowledge, Chris has one year to live."

hpsugpjc3dE,"Diante da repercussão do vídeo divulgado  no dia 15 de fevereiro,  na redes sociais, no qual aparece uma trilha submersa, gostaríamos de passar alguns esclarecimentos. O fato realmente aconteceu no Recanto Ecológico Rio da Prata (Jardim-MS) no dia 02 de fevereiro e foi registrado durante o monitoramento realizado pelo colaborador do passeio, Waldemilson Vera.\n\nQuando chove muito, o rio da Prata corre de forma mais lenta, ocasionando seu represamento, aumentando assim o nível de água do rio Olho D'Água.\n\nApesar da cheia, no dia em que o vídeo foi gravado as águas do rio Olho D'Água continuaram cristalinas devido a sua mata ciliar conservada e por estar dentro de uma Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural - RPPN, um tipo de Unidade de Conservação.\n\nEste foi um episódio raro, e, ao final do dia, o rio já havia voltado ao seu nível normal.\n\nInformamos que nesta data o passeio operou normalmente até o 1º trecho que, apesar de estar também com nível d'água acima do normal, todos os turistas saíram satisfeitos por terem vivenciado um dia diferente e especial no atrativo!\n\nFaced with the repercussion of the video released on February 15, in social networks, which appears a submerged track, we wanted to pass some clarification. The fact really happened at the Rio de Prata Ecological Recanto (Jardim-MS) on February 02 and was recorded during the monitoring carried out by Waldemilson Vera.\n\nWhen it rains a lot, the Rio da Prata river runs of slower form, causing its damming, thus increasing the water level of the Olho D'Água river.\n\nDespite the flood, on the day the video was recorded the waters of the Olho D'Agua river remained crystal clear due to their conserved riparian forest and being inside a Private Reserve of the Natural Patrimony - PRNP, a type of Conservation Unit.\n\nThis was a rare episode, and by the end of the day the river had returned to its normal level.\n\nWe would like to inform that on this date the tour operated normally until the 1st stretch, which, although it is also above normal, all the tourists left satisfied because they experienced a different and special day in the attraction!"

It's downright dumb.\nIt looks like the end of the line for me here and frankly I'm terribly glum\nThat the promising future where I get to train with Luke Skywalker won't ever come\nAnd these shackles I'm shackled in sure seem robust so I'm stuck here on my bum\nIn a base this huge I feel so tiny\nOh and why's that tall Stormtrooper shiny?\nIf I could just find a way into this tin man's head, I\nMight survive to become the second-to-last Jedi\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: What did you say?)\n\nHe responded. That's a start.\nThere's a glimmer of hope in this possibly-orphaned Jakkuvian scavenger's heart\nI can do this, I swear it, by each little line that I drew like a loneliness chart\nI can do this, I swear it, by each little meal that would always taste just like a fart\nBy the bloke I like more than I care to\nBy my sensible three-level hairdo\nI call on the Force and if somehow this works, I said I\nMight survive to become the second-to-last Jedi\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum.)\n\nI'm done for! Blast it!\nThought I had him for a sec\nBut it turns out I'm screwed which has ruined my mood and now I'm a nervous wreck\nFocus! Get past it!\nDo the trick you did back when\nWithout even trying, you found yourself spying on the mind of Kylo Ren\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: I will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.)\nWhaaaat?\n(He unlocks the restraints.)\n\nTa-da! See ya, big guy!\nI cannot believe that it worked, but it worked, and I honestly do not know why\nIf I hurry away before they even know I've fled I\nwill be well on my way or at least one step closer to having a chance to become \nthe second-to-last Jediiiiii!\nAnd you'll drop your weapon. \n(he does)\nYes!\n\n** THANKS FOR WATCHING! :) **\n\nIf you made it all the way to here, comment I hope Daisy Ridley sees this below!"

D_eZxSYRhco,"http://readyplayeronemovie.com\nhttp://facebook.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://twitter.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://instagram.com/readyplayerone\n\n-- \n\nFrom filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes the science fiction action adventure “Ready Player One,” based on Ernest Cline’s bestseller of the same name, which has become a worldwide phenomenon.  \n\nThe film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  \n\n“Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” “Dunkirk”).  \n\nBehind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”\n\nSlated for release on March 29, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures."

c8DogLWrs90,"Earthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. In the event of the next one causing serious damage, make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nEarthquake Preparedness\nEarthquakes are one the world's most deadly natural hazards. Large earthquakes often strike without warning in areas of high population density, which can lead to catastrophic events. \nIt is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt by people, and of those, 100 of them cause damage. \nIn the US alone, the NEIC now locates about 20,000 earthquakes each year, or approximately 55 per day.  All 50 states and 5 US territories can get earthquakes, but the risk is higher in identified seismic zones. Some of the areas most at risk include: the San Andreas Fault in California; the Cascadia Subduction Zone in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska; the New Madrid Fault Zone in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky; and smaller East Coast zones such as the mid-Atlantic, coastal South Carolina, and New England\n\nEarthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. Make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nEMERGENCY TOILET & SUPPLY KIT\n\nMATERIALS\n5-gallon bucket with lid\nPool noodle\nTrash bags (minimum 5-gallon capacity)\nToilet paper\n2-gallon bucket with lid\nEmergency supplies to suit your needs\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nTrim a pool noodle to fit the circumference of the 5-gallon bucket. \nUsing a sharp utility knife or sturdy scissors, cut a slit down the length of the pool noodle to open it up. Be careful to only cut through only one side.\nLine the bucket with heavy duty trash bags. For safety and hygiene, use at least 2 bags to start.\nFit the pool noodle onto the opening of the bucket, over the bags. \nPop the steel handle off the side of the bucket. Thread a roll of toilet paper through and pop the handle back into the side.\nFill the smaller 2-gallon bucket with emergency supplies that you and your family will need (don’t forget your pets too!). \nStart with a custom emergency checklist that includes important phone numbers you’ll need, medications, and supplies that you’ll need to check periodically.\nFood & water - ideally you should include enough drinking water and shelf-stable, nonperishable food to last you and your family for 72 hours. \nFoods that don’t require cooking or heating are best; and if using canned food, check if you need to also include a can opener! Drop some cutlery in the kit too.\nSchedule to check all expiration dates as necessary and remember that water bottles have use-by dates also.\nHand crank portable radio - it may be necessary to rely on news and communication if power is disrupted and lines are down. Include extra batteries.\nPortable lighting - flashlights, light sticks or other battery-powered LED lights are best. Avoid candles in case of potential gas hazards. Include spare batteries, and test batteries periodically.\nFirst aid kit and toiletries, including any prescription and over-the-counter medications, glasses, contact lenses and solution etc\nWet hygiene wipes for body and hands and hand sanitizer are useful if the water goes out\nDust mask and gloves\nShelter and warmth - emergency blankets, regular blankets, tarps, even just an old towel, hand warmers\nToolkit - wrench in case you need to shut of gas or water valves, and a multi-purpose tool for general needs.\nStore the smaller bucket inside the larger bucket. The pool noodle can be removed from the top and stored inside too, along with the toilet paper. Keep the bucket in a handy location.\nAdditional and duplicate supplies should be stored separately in easily accessible locations around the house and other frequented places like your car, workplace etc. \n\n \nQUAKE-PROOFED HOME\nIt’s best not to have heavy objects like mirrors or large frames hung or displayed above beds or couches. Otherwise, anchor them in studs or interlocked hooks to prevent them from falling and causing serious injury.\nClose hooks from other hanging items by bending them shut with pliers or wrapping them with wire.\nSecure precarious furniture such as tall shelves and television screens with furniture straps or L-shaped braces.\nUse museum putty or other nonpermanent sticky putty to hold smaller breakables in place.\nAlternatively, install low, decorative guardrails across shelves and display units to keep items from sliding off. A simple lip from scrap wood can also do the trick.\nAvoid keeping the heaviest items on the top.\nKeep a pair of sturdy shoes, a flashlight and even a hard hat under your bed.\nAttach velcro to additional flashlights and store them near electrical panels, gas and water valves, and other important utilities for quick access.\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty"

Starring Academy and Emmy Award nominee and Golden Globe winner Angela Bassett (“American Horror Story,” “What’s Love Got to Do with It”), the series is based on the real-life, high-pressure experiences of emergency response providers who are thrust into heart-stopping situations that are equal parts unpredictable, intense and uplifting. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. Emmy Award- and Golden Globe-nominated actor Peter Krause (“The Catch,” “Six Feet Under”) and Emmy Award-nominated actress Connie Britton (“Nashville,” “Friday Night Lights,” “American Horror Story”) have been cast in lead roles. Oliver Stark (“Into The Badlands”), Aisha Hinds (“Shots Fired,” “Underground”), Kenneth Choi (“The People v. OJ Simpson: American Crime Story”) and Rockmond Dunbar (“Prison Break,” “The Path”) have been cast in series regular roles. The series will premiere in 2018.\n9-1-1 is produced by 20th Century Fox Television in association Ryan Murphy Television and Brad Falchuk Teley-Vision. The pilot is created, written and executive-produced by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk. Tim Minear is an executive producer and will serve as showrunner. Bradley Buecker is an executive producer and will direct the series premiere.\n\nFirst Responders Arrive To The Collapsed Floor | Season 1 Ep. 5 | 9-1-1\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpTHZPdFG-3GxngAHh6Mkew"

It is an Android application that leverages on-device sensors to provide monitoring and protection of physical spaces.

Kn5UgGQukYQ,"The Hudson Union www.hudsonunionsociety.com is where everyone comes to be inspired, to change our world.\n\nCheck us out on Twitter @ActualJoePascal\n\nBryan Cranston won four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Walter White in AMC’s Breaking Bad. He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2014 he won a Tony Award for his role as Lyndon B. Johnson in the bio-play All the Way. In film, Cranston has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and received an Academy Award nomination for his leading role in Trumbo. Among his numerous television and film appearances, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for his portrayal of Hal in FOX’s Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nBryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father, a struggling actor and director, cast him in a United Way commercial. Soon, Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boy’s destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly, destiny took a back seat to survival.\n\nSeeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Suddenly he thought: This was what he wanted to do, what he would do, with the rest of his life. Act.\n\nEach paid attendee will receive, Brian Cranston’s riveting memoir, A Life in Parts, Cranston traces his zigzag journey from his chaotic childhood to to mega-stardom and a cult-like following\n\nAt the Hudson Union with great humor, and much humility, Cranston will chronicle his unlikely rise from a soap opera regular, trying to learn the ropes and the politics of show business on the fly.  \n\nCranston will dive deep into the grittiest, most fascinating details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most riveting performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin."

It's downright dumb.\nIt looks like the end of the line for me here and frankly I'm terribly glum\nThat the promising future where I get to train with Luke Skywalker won't ever come\nAnd these shackles I'm shackled in sure seem robust so I'm stuck here on my bum\nIn a base this huge I feel so tiny\nOh and why's that tall Stormtrooper shiny?\nIf I could just find a way into this tin man's head, I\nMight survive to become the second-to-last Jedi\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: What did you say?)\n\nHe responded. That's a start.\nThere's a glimmer of hope in this possibly-orphaned Jakkuvian scavenger's heart\nI can do this, I swear it, by each little line that I drew like a loneliness chart\nI can do this, I swear it, by each little meal that would always taste just like a fart\nBy the bloke I like more than I care to\nBy my sensible three-level hairdo\nI call on the Force and if somehow this works, I said I\nMight survive to become the second-to-last Jedi\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum.)\n\nI'm done for! Blast it!\nThought I had him for a sec\nBut it turns out I'm screwed which has ruined my mood and now I'm a nervous wreck\nFocus! Get past it!\nDo the trick you did back when\nWithout even trying, you found yourself spying on the mind of Kylo Ren\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: I will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.)\nWhaaaat?\n(He unlocks the restraints.)\n\nTa-da! See ya, big guy!\nI cannot believe that it worked, but it worked, and I honestly do not know why\nIf I hurry away before they even know I've fled I\nwill be well on my way or at least one step closer to having a chance to become \nthe second-to-last Jediiiiii!\nAnd you'll drop your weapon. \n(he does)\nYes!\n\n** THANKS FOR WATCHING! :) **\n\nIf you made it all the way to here, comment I hope Daisy Ridley sees this below!"

Lily has turned into a polished, upper-class teenager, with a fancy boarding school on her transcript and a coveted internship on her resume; Amanda has developed a sharp wit and her own particular attitude, but all in the process of becoming a social outcast. Though they initially seem completely at odds, the pair bond over Lily's contempt for her oppressive stepfather, Mark, and as their friendship grows, they begin to bring out one another's most destructive tendencies. Their ambitions lead them to hire a local hustler, Tim, and take matters into their own hands to set their lives straight.\n\nhttp://www.ThoroughbredsMovie.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ThoroughbredsMovie\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thoroughbreds/\nhttps://twitter.com/thoroughbreds"

DON'T GIVE UP HOPE - more research will be done, there are other options you haven't tried yet, you will feel present again one day - but just in case that day doesn't come/it takes a while, you might as well enjoy life as best as you can whilst feeling spaced out!\n\nLast year I could barely talk to people I was that spaced out! I didn't want to leave my flat for fear my existence would be snuffed out it felt so fragile. But now I wake up and although I still am living in this weird dreamlike world, I can function and make an impression on the world, despite barely feeling like I'm in it.\n\nIt will be okay!

It might be a bit overkill but it's probably easier than searching specifically for soft water.\n** Add more nigari or lemon juice if necessary\n\n－Sukiyaki Sauce－\n100ml sake\n100ml mirin\n100ml soy sauce\n30g granulated sugar\n\n－Vegetables－\nYou can use any vegetables you like. Here'are the ones I used this time\n\ngreen onion\nChinese cabbage\nshiitake mushroom\ncarrot\nthread konjac\nvery thin, marbled beef slices\n \n\n \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n-Tofu-\n1. Soak the soybeans in water(1200ml). The soaking time depends on the water temperature. \n\nSummer: 25°C/77°F 10 hours\nSpring, Autumn: 15°C/59°F 20 hours\nWinter: 5°C/41°F 30 hours\n\n2. Blend the soybeans and water in a mixer to make namago. (Namago is the Japanese word for that specific blended mixture of soybeans and water).\n3. Boil 1600ml water in a large pan or pot and add the namago and stir for about 10 minutes. Make sure not to burn the namago at the bottom of the pan.\n4. Turn off the heat and strain the namago with a filter cloth to get soy milk. The leftover is called okara and it's very healthy. I normally use it for making cookies. \n5. Mix 20ml nigari (or lemon juice) and 50ml water together to make the coagulant for the soy milk.\n\n(Your coagulant is a substance that will curdle the soy milk. You can use acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, or salt. Nigari, which is magnesium chloride, is popular in Japan, and calcium chloride is popular in North America.\n-huffingtonpost)\n\n6. Heat up the soy milk and keep the temperature at 75°C. Add the nigari-water and stir gently. Do NOT mix too much.  Turn off the heat and leave it for about 10 minutes.\n7. While resting the soy milk, prepare a container for shaping the tofu. You can make holes in the bottom of a paper drink carton or tupperware, or you can just use your filter cloth and tie it up tighly to shapen the tofu as well.\n\n-Sukiyaki Sauce-\n\n1. Add 100ml sake and 100ml mirin in a pot and boil it.\n2. Add the sugar and soy sauce, and let the sugar melt.\n\n-Sukiyaki-\n1. Melt the beef fat* (or just some slices of fatty beef) and cook the green onion (if you have it) in the sukiyaki pot to add flavor to the sauce. Green onion tastes so much sweeter and more flavorful when you fry it first. \n2. Add the sauce and heat it up. Then add tofu, konjac, mushrooms, and anything that takes longer to cook than your other vegetables.\n3. Finally, place everything else.\n\nSukiyaki is a shared Japanese dish where everyone ladles out some of the broth and food into their own bowls. Traditionally, sukiyaki is eaten with a raw beaten egg added to your own bowl, but that might be difficult for you depending on how safe raw eggs are considered where you live. I normally don't eat it with egg so I can enjoy the flavor of beef and vegetables, but if you get a chance to eat sukiyaki, please give it a try!\n\n*In Japan when you buy beef there is usually a bucket nearby where you can also take a cube of beef fat free of charge. If you want you can buy this separately, or you can use beef that has fat on it as well."

Sh*t, we can't just waste these scripts. And Christmas week came along and we all had plans and didn't want to write sins, so we dusted off the Amityville stuff! So... there you go.\n\nTomorrow: Literally another Amityville Horror sins video. \n\nRemember, no movie is without sin! Which movie's sins should we expose next?!\n\nPodcast: http://soundcloud.com/cinemasins\nSins Video Playlist: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-v4c4is-w&list=PLMWfZxj1nTkQBy4AeRGG4xH5d2IIApNPj\nTweet us: http://twitter.com/cinemasins\nReddit with us: http://reddit.com/r/cinemasins\nTumble us: http://cinema-sins.tumblr.com\nCall us: 405-459-7466\nJeremy's book: http://theablesbook.com"

EP5ExDvQ3p4,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday November 28th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, Perri Nemiroff, Ashley Mova discuss the following: \n\n1) Kevin Feige teases ‘finale’ of MCU with Avengers 4\n\n2) James Cameron Says if ‘Avatar’ 2 & 3 Flop There Won’t Be ‘Avatar’ 4 & 5\n\n3) Opening This Week – The Disaster Artist\n\n4) Russell Crowe Teases Potential Movement on a ‘Master and Commander’ Sequel\n\n5) ‘Lady Bird’ Becomes the Best-Reviewed Movie of All-Time on Rotten Tomatoes\n\n6) Mail Bag\n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nIn a sprawling profile in Vanity Fair about the 10-year anniversary of Marvel Studios, the magazine revealed that after the conclusion of Avengers 4, “at least some of the original characters who sit at the center of the billion-dollar Avengers team will be hanging up their capes and shields.” Head honcho Kevin Feige also teased what’s to come after Avengers 4, saying they have about 20 completely different Marvel movies in development, with Avengers 4 acting as the “Finale” to the MCU as we know it. \n\nWhile production has already begun on James Cameron’s Avatar 2 and Avatar 3, the director recently revealed to Vanity Fair that if parts 2 and 3 don’t do well at the box office, then Fox will not move forward on parts 4 and 5. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nIn 2003, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World earned 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director for Peter Weird, and scored two wins for Best Cinematography and Sound Editing. But against a budget of $150 million, the film only made $212 million at the box office, making its sequel prospects unlikely. Now, 15 years later, Russell Crowe has taken to his Twitter account saying a Master and Commander sequel may actually be happening. \n\nWhile it’s very hard to score a perfect 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, it’s not impossible. In the history of the aggregator site, only one movie has scored a perfect 100 and that was Toy Story 2, with 163 reviews certified fresh. But now, we have a new champion and it comes in the form of Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird. The film now has 164 reviews, all of them “Fresh”, giving the film a 100% Fresh rating, as well as crowning it the best reviewed movie of all time. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Perri: https://twitter.com/PNemiroff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

07Um1PY_P4o,"In Theaters January 12, 2018\n\n Following the worldwide hit “Paddington,” one of the most successful family films of all time, this much-anticipated sequel finds Paddington (Ben Whishaw) happily settled with the Brown family in London, where he has become a popular member of the local community, spreading joy and marmalade wherever he goes.  \n\n While searching for the perfect present for his beloved Aunt Lucy’s hundredth birthday, Paddington sees a unique pop-up book in Mr. Gruber’s antique shop, and embarks upon a series of odd jobs to buy it.  But when the book is stolen, it’s up to Paddington and the Browns to unmask the thief.\n \n Reuniting many of the original film’s cast while welcoming those in new roles, “Paddington 2” stars Golden Globe nominee Hugh Bonneville (“Downton Abbey”), Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins (“Blue Jasmine”), three-time Golden Globe nominee Brendan Gleeson (“The Guard,” “Into the Storm,” “In Bruges”), Oscar nominee Julie Walters (“Billy Elliot,” “Educating Rita”), Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (“Iris”), and Oscar winner Peter Capaldi (short, “Franz Kafka’s It’s a Wonderful Life”), with Golden Globe and BAFTA Award winner Hugh Grant (“Four Weddings and a Funeral”), and BAFTA winner Ben Whishaw (“The Hollow Crown”) as the voice of Paddington.  The starring ensemble also includes Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, and Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (“Vera Drake”) as the voice of Aunt Lucy. \n\n Paddington’s return to the big screen was again helmed by BAFTA-nominated director Paul King (“Paddington,” “Come Fly with Me,” “The Mighty Boosh”) from a script written by King and Simon Farnaby (Sky TV’s “Yonderland,” “Mindhorn”), based on the best-selling and internationally adored books by Michael Bond, creator of Paddington Bear.  \n\n The film was produced by multiple award-winning producer David Heyman (the “Harry Potter” films, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” Oscar nominee for “Gravity”).   Serving as executive producers were Rosie Alison, Jeffrey Clifford, Alexandra Ferguson Derbyshire, Ron Halpern, and Didier Lupfer.  \n\n Creative talent returning behind the camera included director of photography Erik Alexander Wilson (“Tyrannosaur,” “Submarine”), production designer Gary Williamson (“Bunny and the Bull,” “Submarine”), Oscar-winning costume designer Lindy Hemming (“Wonder Woman,” “The Dark Knight”), and editor Mark Everson (“Mindhorn,” “Alan Partridge”), joined by editor Jonathan Amos (“Baby Driver”).  Visual effects were provided by the highly acclaimed British VFX company, Framestore, led by animation director Pablo Grillo (“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them”) and VFX supervisors Andy Kind (“Gravity”) and Glen Pratt (“Beauty and the Beast”).  The score is composed by Academy Award winner Dario Marianelli (“Atonement”).  \n\n “Paddington 2” was shot on location in and around central London, as well as on the legendary soundstages of Warner Bros. Leavesden and Pinewood film studios.\n\n Warner Bros. Pictures and STUDIOCANAL present, in association with Anton Capital Entertainment S.C.A., a Heyday Films Production, “Paddington 2.”  The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.  www.paddington.com\n\n “Paddington 2” is rated PG for some action and mild rude humor.\n\n©2017 StudioCanal S.A.S.

The minor difference is due to different methods to analyze global temperatures used by the two agencies, although over the long-term the records remain in strong agreement.

Plunging headlong into the campus experience, the increasingly outspoken Deanna—now Dee Rock—embraces freedom, fun and frat boys on her own terms, finding her true self in a senior year no one ever expected.\n\nThe film also stars Gillian Jacobs (“Don’t Think Twice,” “Love,” “Community”), Maya Rudolph (“Bridesmaids,” “Sisters”), Julie Bowen (“Modern Family”), Matt Walsh (“Veep,” “Ghostbusters”), Molly Gordon (“Love the Coopers,” “Animal Kingdom”), with Stephen Root (“Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates”), and Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver (“Silver Linings Playbook,” “Animal Kingdom”), Jessie Ennis (“Better Call Saul”), Adria Arjona (“True Detective,” “Emerald City”), Debby Ryan (“Jessie”) and Jimmy O. Yang (“Silicon Valley”).\n\nMcCarthy and Falcone co-wrote the screenplay and produced through their production company, On the Day. Chris Henchy also produced the film, with Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Michael Disco and David Siegel serving as executive producers.\n\nFalcone’s behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Julio Macat (“The Boss,” “Horrible Bosses 2,” “Daddy’s Home”); production designer Rusty Smith (“The Boss”); editor Brian Olds (“Central Intelligence”); and costume designer Louise Mingenbach (the “The Hangover” films). The music is by Fil Eisler (“How to Be Single,” “Empire”).\n\nNew Line Cinema Presents, an On the Day Production, “Life of the Party.” Slated for release on May 11, 2018, the film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company. It has been rated PG-13."

zG3PLW534Wg,"Testing the heat loss in my off grid log cabin, I use my infrared thermal imaging camera to take night time photos of the cabin while the wood stove is on, and then again the following morning when the fire is no longer burning. My woodburning stove is not the most efficient for primary heating, so I show exactly how it functions and what I can do to make it more efficient, saving wood and money in the process. It's interesting to see my dog, Cali the Golden Retriever, show up on the thermal image and how cool she is compared to the surrounding walls, table and bed that she's lying on.\nThe tiny house should be very easy to heat once the pointing (mortar) is done inside and out and I can use what I've learned on this log cabin to help me design and build the other structures on my wilderness homestead. Working and collecting firewood alone is challenging, so I want to maximize the efficiency of each building in order to make this long term off grid survival situation more economically feasible. If I can reduce the amount of fuel needed to heat each off grid building, I can provide all of the energy I need for free from the property. This is going to require the installation of rocket stove (rocket mass heater) to use the wood more efficiently.\nI have a few upcoming diy projects that this thermal scan technology will help with - the bread oven, the sauna, the workshop and the maple sugar shack.\n\nLinks to Products Used: \n\nSolar LED light bulb 15W \nhttp://amzn.to/2BQvSQ2 \n\n\nAgawa Canyon Boreal 21 Saw\nhttp://amzn.to/2BPV6OF\n\nCopper Fairy lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2BCmF0X\n\nSolar String Lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2DvgU2n\n\n\nBanneton 12 round \nhttp://amzn.to/2ByxwsF\n\n Lodge Dutch Oven\nhttp://amzn.to/2kHuxDQ\n\nFlamen heat resistant gloves up to 500 degrees\nhttp://amzn.to/2l1mRMm\n\nRocksheat baking stone\n http://amzn.to/2kF6eql\n\nMora Knife\nhttp://amzn.to/2BOiv35\n\nLamp OiI\nhttp://amzn.to/2qz0nZ1 \n\nWall Lantern (candle lit)\nhttp://amzn.to/2Dpa0MK \n\nMoka Pot\nhttp://amzn.to/2DEomvO  Canada\nhttp://amzn.to/2ndmtw6  USA\n\nCanon 6D\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdaZjs\n\nDJI Mavic Pro\nhttp://amzn.to/2DHuJib\n\nBragg's Sprinkle\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdouzK\n\nTo see what I’m up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook – https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) – https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram – https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMailing Address:\nP.O.

FA_gIAGNDQ8,"The steps the president has to take to fire a nuke are involved and complicated, but they work to safeguard against accidental launches and miscommunications.\n\nThat said, the entire process could happen in just a few short minutes. The following is a transcription of the animation.\n\nIt can take the US government just minutes to launch a nuclear weapon. Here's how it would work.\n\nThe president has the sole authority to call for a nuclear strike. Once the call is made, a series of critical steps follow.\n\nThe president first meets with top military advisers. The meeting would take place in the Situation Room. If the president is traveling, a call is made on a secure line.\n\nIf the president still wants to go through with the strike, the order is verified. To authenticate the order, a challenge code is read to the president. It's usually two phonetic letters like Delta-Echo.\n\nThe president then receives the biscuit, a laminated card that's always near the president. The biscuit has the matching response to the challenge code.\n\nThe Pentagon then broadcasts an encoded message to missile crews. The message is only about the length of a standard tweet.\n\nIt includes the war plan, Sealed Authentication System or (SAS) codes, and the actual missile launch codes. When the launch crews get the message they open lock safes to obtain the SAS codes. These codes are compared with the SAS codes included in the message.\n\nIf fired from a submarine the captain, executive officer, and two others authenticate the launch order. Fifteen minutes after receiving the order, the missiles could be ready to launch.\n\nIf fired from land, there are 50 missiles controlled by 5 launch crews in different locations. Each crew votes for the launch by turning their keys at the same time.\n\nThere are five different keys, but only two need to be turned to launch the missiles. In this scenario, the missiles could be ready to launch just minutes after the president's order. Once the missiles are launched, there's no turning back.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

Through one girl’s transformative journey led by three celestial guides, we discover that strength comes from embracing one’s individuality and that the best way to triumph over fear is to travel by one’s own light.\n \nDirected by Emmy(R) winner and Oscar(R) and Golden Globe(R) nominee Ava DuVernay from a screenplay by Oscar winner Jennifer Lee based upon the beloved novel by Madeleine L’Engle, “A Wrinkle in Time” stars: two-time Academy Award(R) nominee Oprah Winfrey, Oscar and Emmy winner Reese Witherspoon, Emmy nominee Mindy Kaling, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Michael Peňa and introducing Storm Reid, with two-time Emmy winner Zach Galifianakis and Emmy nominee Chris Pine.\n \nProduced by Jim Whitaker and Catherine Hand with Doug Merrifield serving as executive producer, the film also boasts an impressive creative team featuring some of the most talented artisans working today, including: Tobias Schliessler, ASC as director of photography, Naomi Shohan as production designer, Oscar(R)-nominee Spencer Averick as film editor, two-time Academy Award(R)-nominee Paco Delgado as costume designer and four time Emmy(R) nominee Ramin Djawadi as composer."

fbL1ZoAQgUU,"Scientists were surprised and delighted to detect --for the first time--  an interstellar asteroid passing through our solar system. Additional observations brought more surprises: the object is cigar-shaped with a somewhat reddish hue. The asteroid, named ‘Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (400 meters) long and highly-elongated—perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide. That is unlike any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date, and may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed. For more info about this discovery, visit https://go.nasa.gov/2zSJVWV ."

Nobody has time for that and they’re like a buck or two\nTake a 13.5oz/398ml can of pure pumpkin. Not “pumpkin pie filling.” Don’t be an animal\nBut that in a bowl. It’s gonna be thick. Be prepared for that\nAdd two eggs\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \n(or if you’re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\nWangjangle that together until it’s smooth. \nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \nReduce it to 350. \nNow here’s where you’re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow."

Nobody has time for that and they’re like a buck or two\nTake a 13.5oz/398ml can of pure pumpkin. Not “pumpkin pie filling.” Don’t be an animal\nBut that in a bowl. It’s gonna be thick. Be prepared for that\nAdd two eggs\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \n(or if you’re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\nWangjangle that together until it’s smooth. \nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \nReduce it to 350. \nNow here’s where you’re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow."

tfREC-AkX20,"How the sleep gap reflects inequality and contributes to it.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nA good night’s rest is critical for your health, and a lot can go wrong when you don’t get enough it. Sleep deprivation can contribute to obesity, diabetes, inflammation, heart disease, and more. The minimum recommended amount for adults is 7 hours (this too can vary from person to person). But, a third of Americans are sleep deprived — and on average, Black Americans are clocking in the least amount of z’s. \n\nBlack Americans already face steep disparities in health, and not getting enough good sleep can compound on those issues. By examining the sleep gap, and addressing the root causes, we may be able to tackle other inequalities in the US too.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Nelson) at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell) and Dash (voice of Huck Milner) to navigate the day-to-day heroics of “normal” life. It’s a tough transistion for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby Jack-Jack’s emerging superpowers. When a new villain hatches a brilliant and dangerous plot, the family and Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) must find a way to work together again—which is easier said than done, even when they’re all Incredible.\n \nDirected by Brad Bird (“Iron Giant,” “The Incredibles”) and produced by John Walker (“The Incredibles”) and Nicole Grindle (“Sanjay’s Super Team” short, “Toy Story 3” associate producer), “Incredibles 2” busts into theaters on June 15, 2018."

It’s surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.\n\nHe also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity — a neutron star, a black hole — and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.\n\nThis is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel — to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.\n\nThe main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really … Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.\n\nIt's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole — put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey — then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel — through this wormhole — you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.\n\nNow again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

rgcE2lMa0Kw,"Earth's surface temperatures in 2017 were the second warmest since since 1880, when global estimates first become feasible, NASA scientists found. \nGlobal temperatures 2017 were second only to 2016, which still holds the record for the hottest year; however, 2017 was the warmest year on record that did not start with an El Nino weather pattern, as the previous two years did. \nIn a separate, independent analysis, NOAA scientists found that 2017 was the third-warmest year in their record. The minor difference is due to different methods to analyze global temperatures used by the two agencies, although over the long-term the records remain in strong agreement.

She was 46.\n\nIrish and international singer Dolores O'Riordan has died suddenly in London today. She was 46 years old. The lead singer with the Irish band The Cranberries, was in London for a short recording session, her rep said in a statement to multiple media outlets, adding that no further details were available.\n\nO’Riordan rose to fame as the gentle voice behind some of The Cranberries’ biggest hits, including “Zombie” and “Linger,” the latter of which, a lilting love song, served as the band’s breakthrough hit in 1993.  The tune, with its distinctive string section, peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nClick here to read more: http://nydn.us/2DAZ8eJ\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/nydailynews\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/nydnvideo\nFriend us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thenewyorkdailynews\nFollow us on Tumblr: http://nydailynews.tumblr.com/"

Kind people are the magnets for all of the good things in life.\n\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE! WE ARE SOOO CLOSE TO 6M MUFFINS!\n\nNEW videos every Wednesday & Sunday!\n*PLEASE SUBSCRIBE & CLICK THE 🔔 FOR NOTIFICATIONS :)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­-------------------------------------\nHi my loves! Happy Sunday! The long awaited closet tour.... I know you guys have been requesting this for almost 3 years now. I never 100% finished but since I am moving I wanted to give you guys a little preview before I start packing up. It's so crazy that I've been in this house almost 3 years already. I will miss it for sure but I am looking forward to the next chapter in my life!! As I mentioned - although it is super fun having all of these nice things... materialistic things do not define a person. I remember in my first apartment 5 years ago - almost to the day -  looking around at everything I had during a really low point in my life. And I swore I would trade every single item in my closet if it meant someone I loved had another chance at life. (long story.. but in that moment I truly realized how little materialistic things actually meant) Unfortunately we spend a lot of our lives wishing and wanting things we may never get. Take it from me- someone who had nothing, worked 3 jobs and barely had money for bills. Now that I am able to buy a lot of things - as exciting as all of this stuff is.. none of it really matters if you are not happy with who you are. Taking care of yourself physically and emotionally and having healthy relationships with your family and friends always comes first and foremost. With all of that saiddddd I hope you guys enjoy this little peak into my 'woman cave' :D Without all of you none of this would ever be possible. I love you guys SO MUCH!!! XOXO Carli\n\nPS. For those who are confused - I bought this house with the intention on living here forever with my x boyfriend. We broke up almost 8 months ago so I decided to sell the house and buy something closer to my friends and family. My dad is living with me now so I have company in this big house! xo\n----------------------------------------­­­-------------------------------------\n\n*Send me LETTERS!!! \nPO Box 6639\nBridgewater NJ 08807\n\nFollow me on Instagram:\nhttp://www.instagram.com/CarliBel\n\nFollow me on SNAPCHAT!\n@CarliPenguin5\n\nDisclaimer: this video is NOT sponsored.

When his glamorous mother (Bette Midler) is forced to send him to live with his straight-laced father (Larry Pine), Billy finds himself a diva-out-of-water at his new ultra-conservative high school. Undaunted by the bullies who don’t understand him, the fearless Billy sets out to make a big statement in his own inimitable way: challenging the school’s reigning mean girl (Abigail Breslin) for the title of homecoming queen.

rBUjOY12gJA,"Leading a more active lifestyle takes time, effort, and determination, but in the end, it's really worth the shot. Here's what will happen to your body when you exercise regularly.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nIf you're thinking about leading a more active lifestyle, you're not alone. In recent years, an increasing number of Americans have started participating in more sports, fitness, and recreation. Whether you're trying to get fit or build muscle, or you're just tired of the couch, here are some changes you can expect along the way.\n\nWhat happens to your body when you start exercising regularly?\n\nDuring that first workout, you might feel more alert and energized because ramping up your heart rate means a boost in overall blood flow and oxygen to the brain. But prepare yourself for the day after, when you'll almost certainly get a case of DOMS, short for delayed onset muscle soreness. The soreness will persist for about 72 hours, but the good news is you're less likely to get it again as long as you continue to regularly exercise those same muscles.\n\nOver the next few weeks you'll slowly start to ramp up production of mitochondria via a process called mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondria are the parts of your cells that convert carbs, fat, and protein into fuel that your muscles use to do their job, like flex and contract. After six to eight weeks, studies have shown that people can increase their mitochondria by up to 50%. With more mitochondria in your cells, you'll start to feel more fit, and your endurance will increase. So running three miles will no longer feel as difficult as it did during that first week.\n\nOnce you're six months in, all that hard work should finally start to show. If your workouts focus on strength training, you'll notice your muscles begin to take shape. You're also less likely to fall off the workout wagon at this point. Exercise programs often see a 50% dropout rate within the first six months, but after that more people stick with it.\n\nNow, if you're more focused on cardio, then by nine months of regular exercise you should see about a 25% increase in your VO2 max. VO2 max is often used as a measure of fitness and refers to the rate your body can transport oxygen to your muscles for fuel. Basically, higher VO2 max means you can run faster for longer. So a 25% increase in VO2 max, for example, means you can run about 20% farther in the same amount of time.\n\nAfter one year of regular exercise, your bones will be denser, which reduces your risk of osteoporosis. In fact, researchers have found that regular resistance training, when combined with aerobic exercise, can actually reverse the effects of osteoporosis after 12 months.\n\nNow, if you maintain your exercise program long term, your body might not be the only thing to benefit. Your bank account may also beef up a bit. One study revealed that older people who exercised five days a week for at least 30 minutes saved, on average, $2,500 a year in medical costs for heart-related health problems alone. You'll also be at a lower risk of developing arthritis, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and certain types of cancer like breast and colon.\n\nIn all probability, you're going to live longer than you otherwise would. And that longer life, it will likely feel more fulfilling, because exercise lowers the risk of anxiety and depression by reducing levels of stress hormones, like cortisol and adrenaline.\n\nOf course all these benefits depend on the type and intensity of your workout and how long you exercise for each week. A balanced diet is also paramount to a healthy lifestyle. For the average adult ages 18 to 64, the US Department of Health and Human Services recommends either a minimum of 2 1/2 hours per week of moderately intense exercise, like brisk walking or biking. Or at least 1 hour and 15 minutes each week that combines moderate and high-intensity workouts, like running or swimming sprints.\n\nOn top of that, make sure and take two days each week to strengthen your muscles with some weights or resistance training. This will help your overall speed and endurance. As you begin, it's important to pace yourself and not push too hard too fast, or you risk serious injury.\n\nYou'll discover that the fitter you become, the easier it will be to exert a little more energy the next week, the week after, and so forth.\n\nExercise smart and often, and you'll be running marathons in no time.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends.

UpGPcHrVUZI,"Hello everybody to another car commercial of the past! Here today, we have a unique car commercial for you guys. A commercial that features the Pontiac lineup for 1991, with the voice of Patrick Stewart narrating over the commercial! Some of the vehicles featured in this commercial are already talked about in my other car commercial videos like the LeMans and Bonneville, so I'll talk about the Pontiac Grand Prix featured in this commercial. \n\nThe Grand Prix had a base 3.1 Liter, 6 cylinder engine that produced 140 horsepower at 4400 RPM with 185 LB-FT of Torque at 3200 RPM. A more powerful 3.4 Liter V6 that produced 210 Horsepower was available as an option.\n\nThe base transmission  on the Grand Prix was a 3 speed automatic, with a 4 speed automatic and 5 speed manual being available as options. Fuel mileage with the optional 4 speed automatic was a decent 17 MPG city, 28 MPG highway. \n\nTwo body styles were offered on the Grand Prix; a 2 door coupe or 4 door sedan. The GT model trim only came in a 2 door coupe.\n \nThree trim levels were offered on the Grand Prix; the LE base trim, the SE mid range trim, the more luxurious STE model trim, and the sport oriented GT trim. The MSRP for the LE entry level trim in a 4 door sedan layout was $14,779, the MSRP for the SE mid range trim was $15,769, the MSRP for the luxury STE model trim in a 4 door layout was $20,479 and the MSRP for the 2 door GT coupe was $19,369.\n\nIf you wanted a modestly priced sport oriented 2 and 4 door vehicle that was Domestic, provided somewhat good performance, matched with decent gas mileage and sleek looks in 1991, then the Pontiac Grand Prix was the car for you.\n\nThere are many more old car commercials uploaded on my channel and many more to come, so check my channel often for more videos!\n\n(Disclosure: I do not own this old car advertisement commercial as it belongs to the General Motors Automobile Corporation.)"

doHVMJnuvDA,"instagram.com/sriram_murali\n\nLost in Light II is a short film showing how light pollution affects the view of the night skies using one of the most prominent constellations - The Orion. The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven’t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they’ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it’s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes. Home Depot has a separate section for dark sky friendly lighting. Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances. Together, we can fight pollution and have our night skies and our identity back.\n\nContact: srirammurali.com/contact/\nMusic: Imagine by Ryan Taubert\nCopyright All Rights Reserved"

RF-Mqs2qC-M,"In this episode of Open Door, Grammy-winning record producer and DJ Zedd gives an in-depth tour of his $16 million mansion in Benedict Canyon, an area of Los Angeles that's near Sherman Oaks and northwest of Beverly Hills. Zedd's self-decorated home is 9,500 square feet with views of the canyon and tons of full-length glass windows. \n\nThe house is structured into three sections: work, living, and sleep. The work section has Zedd's recording studio and an unfinished gym.\n\nThe driveway leads into the front entrance, which crosses a moat. \n\nA huge wall with cubbies holds art, awards, and silly memorabilia. For instance, Zedd's Grammy sits next to a poop emoji.\n\nAt the end of a corridor, before going outside, guests can pick their favorite flavor of the rainbow from the Skittles machine. \n\nZedd also has a server room and a Costco Room that contains just about anything he would need if he weren't able to leave the house for a long time.\n\nThe bathrooms feature automated blinds that can sometimes surprise the person taking the shower early in the morning.\n\nThe remote-controlled curtains in Zedd's bedroom make him the happiest of any feature in the house.\n\nOutside, the pool has a hidden jacuzzi / hot tub that's revealed when the pool's water level drops.\n\nThe kitchen has four built-in hibachi grills, a pot filler above the stovetop (which Zedd says is the reason he bought the house), and built-in vacuums.  \n\nStill haven’t subscribed to Architectural Digest on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/2zl7s34\n\nABOUT ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST\nThe leading international design authority, Architectural Digest features articles and videos of the best in architecture, style, culture, travel, and shopping.\n\nInside Zedd's $16 Million Mansion That Has a Skittles Machine | Open Door | Architectural Digest"

2ktuvx9hrMw,"All Clara (Mackenzie Foy) wants is a key – a one-of-a-kind key that will unlock a box that holds a priceless gift from her late mother. A golden thread, presented to her at godfather Drosselmeyer’s (Morgan Freeman) annual holiday party, leads her to the coveted key—which promptly disappears into a strange and mysterious parallel world. It’s there that Clara encounters a soldier named Phillip (Jayden Fowora-Knight), a gang of mice and the regents who preside over three Realms: Land of Snowflakes, Land of Flowers and Land of Sweets. Clara and Phillip must brave the ominous Fourth Realm, home to the tyrant Mother Ginger (Helen Mirren), to retrieve Clara’s key and hopefully return harmony to the unstable world. Starring Keira Knightley as the Sugar Plum Fairy and featuring a special performance by Misty Copeland, Disney’s new holiday feature film “The Nutcracker and the Four Realms” is directed by Lasse Hallström and inspired by E.T.A. Hoffmann’s classic tale.

It was super fun working with Maren because she is clearly an amazing singer and very talented musician.  And, I always love working with Grey because we push ourselves to make the best music possible and the end result is incredible. - Zedd\n \nI met Zedd in Nashville several weeks ago when he came to town to record my vocal for “The Middle”. My fans know that my sounds is reflective of my many influences as a songwriter and artist and I think they’ll be ecstatic to hear this collaboration with him and Grey! - Maren Morris\n \nSome songs come really quickly and naturally, but for a while there it seemed like this song didn’t want to come out.

There are 3.5 million professional drivers in the US, all of whom may face job displacement in the autonomous future being developed by companies like Otto, Daimler, and Tesla. But before robots take the wheel entirely, there will be a long period where truckers and artificial technology split the responsibilities of the work. The first big step toward that future comes in the form of the electronic logging device, a dashboard monitor that tracks speed, location, and a driver's schedule, and reports it to an employer or a third-party monitoring service. It has a lot of truckers worried. \n\nRead Karen Levy's work here: \nhttps://goo.gl/XHYuvv \nhttps://goo.gl/BVJWmY\n\nRead the FMCSA's report on ELD safety:\nhttps://goo.gl/ydYx1R\n\nRead the NAS report on driving fatigue:\nhttps://goo.gl/VJVZMa\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

pRnCk5QeXdw,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Monday, February 26th, 2018) Mark Ellis, Perri Nemiroff, Jon Schnepp, and Kristian Harloff discuss the following:\n\n1) Black Panther Scores Second Highest Second Weekend Box Office Ever\n\n2) ‘Batgirl’ Movie: Female Writers Throw Their Hats Into the Ring\n\n3) Ryan Coogler Explains Why He’s Not Directing ‘Creed 2’\n\n4) Zac Efron Shares New On-Set Pictures from His Ted Bundy Biopic\n\n5) Alex Garland Reveals Another Possible Adaptation of ‘The Beach’ Is in the Works\n\n6) Yardie Trailer: The New Thriller Directed by Idris Elba\n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nBlack Panther continues its domination at the box office, pulling in $108 million over its second weekend at the box office — the second-highest second weekend ever behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The 18th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe declined only 46%, beating other record holders Jurassic World at $106.6 million, and 2012’s The Avengers with $103 million.\n\nAs soon as news broke that Joss Whedon would be leaving The Batgirl adaptation at DC Films, two acclaimed female writers took to their social media, throwing their hats in the ring.\n\nIn a new interview with Kristopher Tapley on Variety’s Playback podcast, Ryan Coogler confirmed the reason he’s not directing Creed 2. In the in depth interview, Coogler touched on how personal the movie Creed was, and how it truly was a story about his own father, before explaining: “There’s timing, and that film for whatever reason it had to go when it’s going.”\n\nZac Efron took to his Instagram to share some of the first looks of him and the cast of the Ted Bundy biopic entitled Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile. The images show Efron in a number of behind the scenes looks, as well as working alongside The Big Bang Theory star Jim Parson.\n\nIn a recent Reddit AMA with director Alex Garland and his latest, Annihilation, Garland revealed that another adaptation of his novel The Beach was in the works with “someone very talented.”\n\nStudio Canal UK released the first trailer for Sundance thriller Yardie, marking the feature directorial debut of Idris Elba. Set in ’70s Kingston and ’80s Hackney, Yardie centers on the life of a young Jamaican man named D.\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Perri: https://twitter.com/PNemiroff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider is more than an essential destination.

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost.\n\nFollowing liftoff, the two side boosters separated from the center core and returned to landing site for future reuse.  \n\nFalcon Heavy put a Tesla Roadster and its passenger, Starman, into orbit around the sun.

42FRgdjveGU,"World-renowned Canadian person, prolific marijuana-doer, and winner of the 2015 MTV Movie Award for “Best Kiss” Seth Q. Rogen has entered into a lifetime deal to transfer full ownership of his personal autonomy to Netflix, Inc. \n\n“I have known Seth for many years” said senior Netflix Development Executive Jareth Chumley. “After a wrap party in late 2017, Seth approached me and said something like ‘Jesus Fucking Christ Jarbear, I would sell my soul for a fuckin enchilada right now.’ And so basically that was how the idea was born. In the end we settled on a price a little higher than a standard Chili’s To-Go entree, but I’ll be damned, not by that much.”\n\n“As a general rule, I don’t really ‘read’ anything before I sign it,” replied Rogen when asked about the deal, spilling some beer on his own head as he does the finger-symbol equivalent of air quotes. “That’s what Danny is for, he handles that for me, mostly,” gesturing toward an elderly man in a poncho sleeping on the couch behind him. “Hey Danny!” he shouts, unable to wake his senior contract advisor. “I really hope he didn’t fuck this up. He’s the reason that Zach and Miri Make a Porno exists.”\n\nSeth Rogen’s Hilarity for Charity is the first project where Netflix was able to successfully extract comedy directly from the actor’s mind. It will stream April 6. While the remaining projects Rogen will be participating in have not yet been finalized, Netflix is considering a live-action Shrek remake, starring Rogen as both the titular character, as well as that character’s love interest Fiona. There will also be other tasks considered, including some off-camera roles such as “executive foot massager” and “Quentin’s back waxer”. “The world really is our oyster here,” said Netflix Chief Operations Officer Karen Shartwell. “There really isn’t anything on earth that we can’t make him do.”\n\nWatch Hilarity For Charity on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/80189646\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 117 million members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films.

No single notes. \n\nA tritone is referring to a particular musical interval (how far away two notes are from each other) and is renowned for it's dissonance and harsh feeling of tension. A tritone name refers to the 3 whole tone distance between the two notes.\n\nIt's used to great effect in a lot of different genres, but straight up 2 note only tritone chords I most closely associate with Deathcore. And I can't think of anywhere else where it's used anywhere near as often. Particular the band Oceano came to mind while writing this.\n\nIt's rumored that the tritone was banned in medieval times, that you could be jailed for using it, that people believed it could summon the devil...  None of which are actually true, but make for a great story that really fits in well with this harsh musical interval.\n\nHere's me chatting about writing this after being thrust into the underworld: https://youtu.be/651DVX5w3Ow\n\nMixed by Ryan Fluff Bruce: https://www.youtube.com/user/Fluff191\nVideo edit by Jake Jarvi: https://www.youtube.com/pineappleboyfilms/\n\nThis video was made possible because of Patreon support from Tianyu Ge, Navin Antoine, Brad Tucker, Jaz Maglana, Blayd Malburne, Andrew Johnston, Cody Melcher, Caleb Chalfin, Otto Cate, Nicolette Kawata, Tyler Feinman, Haroon Rahman, Quintin Waldner, Hypergnome, Stefan Gunn, Andy AKA VaultsOfExtoth, Rob Harper, & many other awesome people on my Patreon page: http://www.patreon.com/RobScallon\nThank you so much!\n\nMusic videos go on the main.

b33PN2NB2Do,"Until the Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, the Green Book was critical for black Americans wanting to travel across the country. \n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nRoad tripping in the 20th century became an iconic American obsession, and the rising middle class was eager to travel the country on the new interstate highway system. The Green Book was a unique travel guide during this time, when segregation was practiced all over the country.\n\nThe book, which grew to cover locations in all 50 states, listed hotels, restaurants, gas stations, beauty salons, and other services that would reliably serve African Americans. The listings grew from user correspondence and a network of African American postal workers under the guidance of Victor Hugo Green, the book’s publisher.\n\nThe American road trip would go on to be an anchor in the civil rights discussion, as it highlighted the injustices and prejudice that African Americans suffered under Jim Crow. Before the Civil Rights Act outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations, Victor Green’s booklet helped black Americans navigate their country. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Returning in a more boyish style, Samuel released the title track ‘Candy’ with the new jack swing-based arrangement of the 1990s. Particularly, a special artist, producer D.O, participated in ‘Talkbox’ of the title track ‘Candy’. The second collaboration between Brave Brother and D.O is raising expectations. \n\n#1theK#원더케이#Newrelease#Samuel#사무엘#캔디#Candy\n\n▶1theK FB  : http://www.facebook.com/1theK\n▶1theK TW : https://twitter.com/1theK\n▶1theK Kakao : https://goo.gl/otRpZc\n\n[ 사무엘 ]\n\n‘사무엘(Samuel)’ 의 데뷔앨범 [SIXTEEN]에서 소년다운 모습을 보여준 ‘사무엘(Samuel)’ 이 3개월 만에 정규 1집 [EYE CANDY]으로 돌아왔다.\n더욱더 소년다운 느낌으로 돌아온 ‘사무엘’의 타이틀곡 '캔디'는 1990년대를 풍미한 뉴잭스윙 장르 기반의 편곡이 인상적인 곡이다. 특히 이번 타이틀곡 ‘캔디’에는 특별한 아티스트가 참여하였는데 바로 프로듀서 '이현도(D.O)'의 ‘Talkbox’ 참여가 눈길을 이끈다. ‘용감한 형제’ 와 ‘이현도(D.O)’의 또 한 번의 호흡이 기대를 모은다."

Watch the first trailer for #MammaMia2, coming to theaters summer 2018. \n--\nFacebook:http://po.st/MM2FB\nTwitter: http://po.st/MM2TW\nInstagram: http://po.st/MM2IG \nWebsite: http://www.mammamiamovie.com/\n--\nGet ready to sing and dance, laugh and love all over again.\n\nTen years after Mamma Mia! The Movie grossed more than $600 million around the world, you are invited to return to the magical Greek island of Kalokairi in an all-new original musical based on the songs of ABBA.  With the film’s original cast returning and new additions including Lily James (Cinderella, Baby Driver), the musical comedy will open on July 20, 2018.\n\nMamma Mia! Here We Go Again is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, producers of the original film.  Craymer is also the creator and producer of the worldwide smash-hit stage musical.  \n\nOl Parker, writer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, writes and directs the sequel from a story by Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis and Parker.  Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus return to provide music and lyrics and serve as executive producers.  Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Phyllida Lloyd, Richard Curtis and Nicky Kentish Barnes also serve as executive producers.\n\nReprising their roles from Mamma Mia! The Movie are Academy Award® winner Meryl Streep as Donna, Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper reunite as Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Oscar® winner Colin Firth return to play Sophie’s three possible dads: Sam, Bill and Harry.\n\nAs the film goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present, James will play the role of Young Donna.  Filling the roles of Young Rosie and Young Tanya are Alexa Davies (A Brilliant Young Mind) and Jessica Keenan Wynn (Broadway’s Beautiful).  Young Sam will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), while Young Bill is Josh Dylan (Allied) and Young Harry is Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends)."

9ZrAjnPHzjQ,"Made this printer out of a scanner, CD-ROM drive, mechanical hard drive, Arduino Duemilanove, Meccano, three motor driver boards, and a pencil.\n\nI use a point cloud software called CloudCompare to convert image data into a raster, and then export it as an ascii text file containing x,y,z,color values. Z is obviously always zero and is ignored. A value that isn't white for color tells the printer to smash the pencil (black and white only). X and y values are used to articulate the mechanisms. The reason I process the images this way is because it's just easier for me than figuring out how to read image files in Arduino code.\n\nTo print, the ascii text file is streamed over the usb serial connection to the Arduino via HyperTerminal (using XON/XOFF for flow control). Print resolution / size is 255 pixels wide by however long the scanner bed is.\n\nI believe it could also be useful in the kitchen for chopping vegetables."

See the film in theatres this Thanksgiving.\n\n“Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2” leaves Litwak’s video arcade behind, venturing into the uncharted, expansive and thrilling world of the internet—which may or may not survive Ralph’s wrecking. Video game bad guy Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly) and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (voice of Sarah Silverman) must risk it all by traveling to the world wide web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope’s video game, Sugar Rush. In way over their heads, Ralph and Vanellope rely on the citizens of the internet—the netizens—to help navigate their way, including a webite entrepreneur named Yesss (voice of Taraji P. Henson), who is the head algorithm and the heart and soul of trend-making site “BuzzzTube.” Directed by Rich Moore (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph”) and Phil Johnston (co-writer “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Cedar Rapids,” co-writer “Zootopia,”), and produced by Clark Spencer (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Bolt”), “Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-Ralph 2” hits theaters on Nov. 21, 2018.\n\nSee more from official Disney Animation:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneyanimation\n\nWelcome to the official Walt Disney Animation Studios YouTube channel!

aBQDFQwfX2w,"What would bring together the hyper-competitive people from Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest during the holidays? A good old-fashioned a cappella sing-off, that’s what. In late November the San Francisco Conservatory of Music hosted the fifth annual installment of “Techapella,”a showcase for the a cappella singing clubs of some of the most powerful companies in the world.\n\nThe event was founded by Laolee Xiong, a security specialist at Facebook. It was initially a way to have a competition with his friends who sang in Google’s group, “Googapella.” Then he mentioned it to his friend at Google and suggested that they do “some kind of Pitch Perfect-style sing-off,” said Xiong.\n\nAfter an informal singing battle at each of the tech giant’s campuses, the a cappella groups from other companies (Twitter has “The Song Birds” and Pinterest has “the Pintunes”) reached out to Xiong to organize a larger event, and “Techapella” was born. More than 1,500 fans attended the two-night event.\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo"

Some plastic bags, plastic bottles, plastic cups, plastic sheets, plastic buckets, plastic sachets, plastic straws, plastic baskets, plastic bags, more plastic bags, plastic, plastic, so much plastic!\nSurprise, surprise, there weren't many Mantas there at the cleaning station today... They mostly decided not to bother.\n\nUPDATE:\nAs expected, the next day, what the currents bringeth, the currents taketh away!\nThe divers who went to Manta Point report they saw no plastic/trash at all. Great for the mantas coming in for a clean at the station, but, sadly the plastic is continuing on its journey, off into the Indian Ocean, to slowly break up into smaller and smaller pieces, into microplastics. But not going away."

sfweKCYOPFc,"Here is what you'll need!\n\n1. A Chinese takeout container unfolds into a plate! \nRemove the metal handle from the box, and unfold the tabs on either side. It will unfold into a convenient paper plate!  \n\n2. You probably don't realize it, but your pots come with built-in spoon rests.\nDon’t rest your stirring spoon on the kitchen counter, it will only spread mess! Instead, put your spoon into the hole at the end of your pot handle.\n\n3.You've been dispensing Tic Tacs the hard way.\nYou probably dispense your mints by furiously shaking the box upside down, only for a heap of them to spill out. Instead turn the box upside down, slowly open the lid, and then pull the box back. A single mint will be sitting in a tic tac-shaped groove inside the lid. \n\n4. Play Doh is for cleaning wallpaper.\nWhat now is an iconic, squishy, children's toy, was originally invented for the purpose of cleaning wallpaper.\n\n5. Your bobby pins are on upside down\nThe correct way to wear a bobby pin is the flat side up for maximum hold! \n\n6. Does your foil roll never stay in the box?\nMost aluminum foil, plastic wrap, and kitchen paper rolls come with punch-in tabs on either sides of the box. The tabs hold the roller in place as you pull on your foil. \n\n7. You're probably using the wrong plunger.\nThe classic brown suction cupped plunger is actually for clearing blockages in a sink, not your toilet! A toilet plunger has a double thrust force cup to help get deep down into the block and has extra force for tough clogs. \n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/33836\n\n\nMUSIC\nBoss Man\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc."

The main theme of ‘Heroine’ is ‘a flower locked in ice’, describing the earlier story of ‘Gashina’ in which the woman had to accept the sad breakup by saying ‘Why do you leave behind pretty me?’ to herself. This track delicately describes the woman’s frozen heart with SUNMI’s sensibility, who gets hurt by the lopsided relationship with the person she loves but tries to understand the person.   \n \n#SUNMI#선미#Heroine#주인공#Newrelease#MV#1theK#원더케이\n\n▶1theK FB  : http://www.facebook.com/1theK\n▶1theK TW : https://twitter.com/1theK\n▶1theK Kakao : https://goo.gl/otRpZc"

Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there’s nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\n\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\n\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? I’ve been excited for the movie but don’t know how to take the limited reactions I’ve been seeing. Help.\n\nPATREON Supporter Jason Kaiser - You mentioned that Disney was in talks to buy Fox in order to compete with Netflix. If that’s the case, why doesn’t Disney just forget about Fox and just buy Netflix?\n\nAlfred Agcaoili - Aloha John. Big fan of your show. Now that the first reactions by movie critics have come out for The Justice League, do you still believe that it will become the #1 comic book movie of 2017 and join the Billion Dollar Club?"

76LcOD4aY-o,"WHITE PINE, Tenn. - An adorable Nativity scene in an East Tennessee church took a hilarious turn when the little girl playing a sheep decided to play with baby Jesus.\n\nAt the First Baptist Church of White Pine, the kids of their live Nativity scene stole the show, but not for the reason you may think.\n\nWhile the children's choir sang Away In A Manger the scene began to unravel. \n\nThe sheep, played by Tana Benson's little girl, Teegan, got up, took baby Jesus out of the manger and began to play with the doll on stage.\n\nLaughter could be heard from parents and audience members as she continued to play and dance with the doll.\n\nYet, it wasn't until the little girl playing Mary decided to take matters into her own hands and take the doll back.\n\nShe and the sheep struggled for a brief moment, before Mary was able to get the doll back in the manger.\n\nBenson said in her Facebook post, that has since gone viral, that she laughed until she cried."

yqulWPljawo,"Jimmy’s baby Billy had his second open heart surgery last week so Jimmy had guest hosts fill in for him while he was out. Thankfully the surgery was a success and Jimmy returned to the show tonight with Billy in tow to show everyone how well he is doing. Jimmy thanks the bright and talented doctors and nurses at Children’s Hospital LA. He has to have one more surgery when he is around six years old and then he is good to go. However, the fight is not over for millions of children whose health is threatened right now because a program called CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program), that is there to protect them, is in serious need of funding because Congress recently failed to approve funding for it. This is not a partisan issue. Democrats and Republicans have always overwhelmingly supported it – until now. Now it’s being used as a bargaining chip. So Jimmy is encouraging everyone to call the House and Senate at (202) 225-3121 to tell them to take a break from tax cuts and fully fund CHIP now. Also, if you don’t have health insurance make sure to go to healthcare.gov and sign up before the December 15th deadline. #FundCHIPNow\n\nMelissa McCarthy vs. Jennifer Aniston – The Great Gravity Debate https://youtu.be/ncHhjUllA7s\n \nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest #KIMMEL: http://bit.ly/JKLSubscribe\n \nWatch Mean Tweets: http://bit.ly/KimmelMT10\n \nConnect with Jimmy Kimmel Live Online:\n \nVisit the Jimmy Kimmel Live WEBSITE: http://bit.ly/JKLWebsite\nLike Jimmy Kimmel on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/KimmelFB\nLike Jimmy Kimmel Live on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/JKLFacebook\nFollow @JimmyKimmel on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/KimmelTW\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/JKLTwitter\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on INSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/JKLInstagram\n \nAbout Jimmy Kimmel Live:\n \nJimmy Kimmel serves as host and executive producer of Emmy-winning Jimmy Kimmel Live, ABC's late-night talk show.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live is well known for its huge viral video successes with 5.6 billion views on YouTube alone.\nSome of Kimmel's most popular comedy bits include - Mean Tweets, Lie Witness News, Jimmy's Twerk Fail Prank, Unnecessary Censorship, YouTube Challenge, The Baby Bachelor, Movie: The Movie, Handsome Men's Club, Jimmy Kimmel Lie Detective and music videos like I (Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum and a Blurred Lines parody with Robin Thicke, Pharrell, Jimmy and his security guard Guillermo.\nNow in its fifteenth season, Kimmel's guests have included: Johnny Depp, Meryl Streep, Tom Cruise, Halle Berry, Harrison Ford, Jennifer Aniston, Will Ferrell, Katy Perry, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, George Clooney, Larry David, Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Kobe Bryant, Steve Carell, Hugh Jackman, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Garner, Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston, Jamie Foxx, Amy Poehler, Ben Affleck, Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, Oprah, and unfortunately Matt Damon.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Returns with Baby Billy After Heart Surgery\nhttps://youtu.be/yqulWPljawo"

But beyond the selection of fresh fruit and fish, the market has become infamous for one thing—the train that runs directly through it. In 1905, the Maeklong Railway built a commuter train line through the center of the popular market. But rather than move, the vendors adapted to the new conditions, working around the train that passes through eight times a day, seven days a week.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/vR6Acb\n\nThis story is a part of our Flavors series, where we do so much more than play with our food.

This was the first Oscar win for Peele, he said, This means so much to me. I stopped writing this movie 20 times because I thought... no one would ever make this movie. This is a historic win as Peele is the first black writer to win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nIn Get Out, photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is nervous about meeting his girlfriend Rose's parents for the first time, especially when he learns that she has not told them that he is black. Their awkward behavior, along with the oddness exhibited by their two African-American servants, puts Chris on alert but even so, he is unprepared for the family's true motivations.\n\nWatch the trailer on Oscar.com here: http://oscar.go.com/video/best-actor-nominees/get-out-trailer\n\nFor more Oscars highlights and can't miss moments visit Oscar.com:\nAcceptance Speeches & Interviews: http://oscar.go.com/video \nRed Carpet Galleries: http://oscar.go.com/red-carpet\nWinners: http://oscar.go.com/winners"

xYShiXMGULE,"A few months back I logged onto Facebook and was greeted by a smiling homeless woman's selfie in front of a tent holding up a cup of coffee. It was captioned good morning. Today, I met Manda at her homeless encampment where she made me a cup of coffee!\n\nMost of the time I meet homeless people in person on the streets or in a homeless shelter. Then we often connect online and become friends. Manda and I became friends online first. I got to know her a little before seeing how she survives homelessness.  I am having a hard time processing it all. Lots of emotions both good and bad right now! \n\nManda is an amazing woman. She is disabled from severe brain trauma, yet because she is high functioning, she falls through the gaps in the safety net. I have been working with her trying to help find a path out of homelessness, but the walls bureaucracy are impossible to break through. \n\nFor all the people that believe homeless people are lazy, I wish they could just spend an hour in Manda's shoes! She works hard to keep her tent camp clean. She works hard getting to treatment and therapy. She works hard every single day trying to survive. And she works extremely hard to stay positive while facing the madness of homelessness each and every day! \n\nWe must get Manda out from under that bridge into housing. Because of her health and being a woman out on the streets, she is extremely vulnerable living outside. If you are connected to social services in Seattle or know anyone that is, please reach out to them and forward Manda's story. I have talked to her social worker. Her health issues are severe, and we need to get this woman inside! \n\nManda vlogs on her Facebook page you can find here https://www.facebook.com/mandycampmom/\n\nIf you'd like to help support her directly this is her GoFundMe page https://www.gofundme.com/4qcfk0o\n\nYou can also find Manda on Twitter https://twitter.com/RicherAmanda\n\n________________________________________________\n\nSubscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/c/invisiblepeople?sub_confirmation=1\n\nInvisible People's website:\n\nhttp://invisiblepeople.tv\n\nSupport Invisible People:\n\nhttps://invisiblepeople.tv/donate\n\nOn Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/invisiblepeople\n\nInvisible People's Social Media: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/invisiblepeople\nhttps://twitter.com/invisiblepeople\nhttps://www.instagram.com/invisiblepeople\nhttps://www.facebook.com/invisiblepeopletv\n\nMark Horvath's Twitter: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/hardlynormal\n\nAbout Invisible People: \n\nSince its launch in November 2008, Invisible People has leveraged the power of video and the massive reach of social media to share the compelling, gritty, and unfiltered stories of homeless people from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. The vlog (video blog) gets up close and personal with veterans, mothers, children, layoff victims and others who have been forced onto the streets by a variety of circumstances. Each week, they're on InvisiblePeople.tv, and high traffic sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, proving to a global audience that while they may often be ignored, they are far from invisible.\n\nInvisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can't ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation's most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath – its founder – and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America's homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.\n\nInvisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness."

D_eZxSYRhco,"http://readyplayeronemovie.com\nhttp://facebook.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://twitter.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://instagram.com/readyplayerone\n\n-- \n\nFrom filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes the science fiction action adventure “Ready Player One,” based on Ernest Cline’s bestseller of the same name, which has become a worldwide phenomenon.  \n\nThe film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  \n\n“Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” “Dunkirk”).  \n\nBehind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”\n\nSlated for release on March 29, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures."

Do people really subscribe because of Stranger Things or Punisher and will anyone drop out when it's over?  I didn't and I won't. Thanks for taking my question. \n\nPATREON Supporter Ali Hussein - Hi John greeting from Sweden love your show. My question is: Now that fox Disney deal is done. When do you think Disney/Marvel going to announced the new cast for X-Men. Do you think before 2020 or after. Love do hear your thoughts.\n\nJoshua Martin - With Disney's recent acquisition of Fox properties, namely the X-men/Deadpool and F4, does this give Disney/Marvel more power or leverage to either 1. Renegotiate their deal with Sony (after homecoming 2) to allow more Spiderman characters into the MCU at their control (or simply buy them) or 2. Buy back the rights to Hulk and Namor from Universal?\n\nRene Bernard - Hey John. CNN reported that Star Wars: The Last Jedi became the second largest opening Thursday night movie in history with $45 million dollars. With those numbers, do you still think it won’t catch The Force Awakens opening weekend box office record?"

c_KdAO6MqiM,"Documentaire in seven parts:Tim Rollins and his collaborators, high school students from the South Bronx, NY, typically make works based on classic literature. He discovered that his students responded to art - art taught his way, not the way it is usually taught in public schools. Some of Rollins' students became a group of regulars who participated in an after-school and weekend program called the Art of Knowledge Workshop. The students named themselves K.O.S. which stands for Kids of Survival. What we're doing changes people's conception about who can make art, how art is made, who can learn and what's possible, because a lot of these kids had been written off by the school system. This is our revenge."

The film is produced by Todd Garner and Mark Steilen, with Hans Ritter, Richard Brener, Walter Hamada and Dave Neustadter serving as executive producers.\n\nThe creative filmmaking team includes director of photography Larry Blanford, production designer David Sandefur, editor Josh Crockett, and costume designer Denise Wingate.  \n\n“Tag” is set for a June 15, 2018, release.  \n\nA New Line Cinema presentation of a Broken Road Production, “Tag” will be distributed by Warner Bros.

Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summer’s events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dad’s footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdale’s young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. It’s all weighing heavily on Archie’s mind — as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but she’s not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Betty’s nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (Mädchen Amick), aren’t the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), there’s an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesn’t want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then there’s Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdale’s Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own. What, exactly, is she hiding about the mysterious death of her twin brother, Jason? Riverdale may look like a quiet, sleepy town, but there are dangers in the shadows. \nBased on the characters from Archie Comics, RIVERDALE is from Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions, with executive producers Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (“Supergirl,” “Glee”), Greg Berlanti (“Arrow,” “The Flash,” “Supergirl,” “DC’s Legends of Tomorrow”), Sarah Schechter (“Arrow,” “The Flash,” “Supergirl,” “DC’s Legends of Tomorrow”) and Jon Goldwater (Archie Comics).\n\nConnect with RIVERDALE Online:\nLearn more about RIVERDALE : http://cwtv.com/shows/riverdale\nLike RIVERDALE on FACEBOOK:https://www.facebook.com/CWRiverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/CW_Riverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/thecwriverdale/\n\nAbout The CW:\nOfficial YouTube Channel for the CW Television Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as Black Lightning, Life Sentence, The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DC’s Legends of Tomorrow, Supernatural, Jane The Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Originals, The 100, iZombie, Dynasty, and Valor.\n\nConnect with The CW Online:\nVisit The CW WEBSITE: http://on.cwtv.com/home\nLike The CW on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/thecw \nFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TUMBLR: http://cwnetwork.tumblr.com\nAdd The CW on GOOGLE+: http://plus.google.com/+thecw\nFollow The CW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw\n \nRiverdale | Chapter Twenty-Six: The Tell-Tale Heart Trailer | The CW\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CWtelevision"

Yet while we have no problem with going to the gym to get fitter, it sounds deeply weird, even creepy, to suggest that one might ‘work’ at being better or nicer…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects on our blog, here: https://goo.gl/17DqjX\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nOur website has classes, articles and products to help you think and grow: https://goo.gl/b461ah\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nYou can submit translations and transcripts on all of our videos here: https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&tab=2 \nFind out how more here: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB \n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nDownload our App: https://goo.gl/7m4wde\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nKhyan Mansley\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Khyan1\nhttps://twitter.com/khyan?lang=en"

Check out his website: http://wolfgangpuck.com/\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nSalmon with Pesto Veggie Noodles by Wolfgang Puck\nServings: 2\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 shallot\n2 cloves garlic\n5 large leaves basil\n¼ bunch flat leaf parsley\n1 pint cherry tomatoes\n1 teaspoon chili flakes\nSalt, to taste\nPepper, to taste\n1 lemon\n¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for cooking\n2 6-ounce fillets of salmon, skin off\n1 yellow squash\n1 zucchini\n2 carrots\n2 watermelon radishes\n\nPREPARATION\nFinely dice the shallot and add it to a medium bowl. \nMince the garlic and add it to the bowl with the shallot. \nChiffonade the basil, chop the parsley, and add to the bowl. \nQuarter the cherry tomatoes and add them to the bowl with the herbs, along with the chili flakes, a pinch of salt and pepper, the juice of one lemon, and the olive oil. Stir to combine.\nHeat a bit of oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. \nSeason the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. When the oil is shimmering, sear the salmon on one side until golden brown. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown and the fish is cooked through. Remove the salmon from the heat and wipe out the skillet.\nCut the squash, zucchini, carrots, and watermelon radishes in half, if needed, then spiralize.\nHeat a bit of oil in the pan over medium heat until simmering. \nAdd the vegetable noodles to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Saute until tender, about 2 minutes. \nDivide the vegetable noodles between two plates. \nPlace a piece of salmon on each bed of noodles, then top with tomato sauce.\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nWolfgang Puck's Trout in Puff Pastry\nServings: 6\n\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n½ cup celery, sliced \n½ cup leeks, julienned\n½ cup carrots, julienned\nSalt, to taste\nWhite pepper, to taste\n1 cup heavy cream\n1 whole trout, cleaned\nBlack pepper, to taste\n2 tablespoons fresh tarragon, chopped\n2 sheets puff pastry\n2 eggs, beaten\nParsley, for serving\nLemon wedges, for serving\n\nChive Butter Sauce:\n1 cup white wine\nJuice of one lemon\n4 shallots, minced\n½ bunch tarragon \n1 cup heavy cream\n18 tablespoons (2 ¼ sticks) butter, sliced\nSalt, to taste\nPepper, to taste\n2 bunches chives, minced\n \nPREPARATION\nHeat the olive oil in a medium pan over medium heat. \nAdd the celery, leeks, carrots, and a pinch of salt and white pepper, and sauté until the vegetables start to cook down. \nAdd the cream and stir to coat the vegetables. Cook until the cream is thickened.\nRemove the pan from the heat.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out both sheets of puff pastry until they are ⅓-inch thick. Transfer one sheet of puff pastry to the baking sheet.\nCut the trout along the back to remove the spine, then butterfly open. Season with salt, pepper, and the tarragon. \nScoop the cooked vegetables onto one side of the fish, then fold over the other fillet. \nTransfer the fish to the center of the sheet of puff pastry. \nBrush egg wash around the fish, then lay on the second sheet of puff pastry, pressing around the fish to seal. Use a paring knife to cut away the excess puff pastry in the shape of a fish. \nBrush the top of the puff pastry with egg wash and use the leftover pastry scraps to decorate the fish with an eye and gills. Use the tip of the knife or the large opening of a pastry tip to draw scales on the body and tail. \nChill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.\nMake the Chive Butter Sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the wine, lemon juice, shallots, and tarragon. Reduce until only a ¼ cup of liquid remains.

The Movie grossed more than $600 million around the world, you are invited to return to the magical Greek island of Kalokairi in an all-new original musical based on the songs of ABBA.  With the film’s original cast returning and new additions including Lily James (Cinderella, Baby Driver), the musical comedy will open on July 20, 2018.\n\nMamma Mia! Here We Go Again is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, producers of the original film.  Craymer is also the creator and producer of the worldwide smash-hit stage musical.  \n\nOl Parker, writer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, writes and directs the sequel from a story by Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis and Parker.  Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus return to provide music and lyrics and serve as executive producers.  Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Phyllida Lloyd, Richard Curtis and Nicky Kentish Barnes also serve as executive producers.\n\nReprising their roles from Mamma Mia! The Movie are Academy Award® winner Meryl Streep as Donna, Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper reunite as Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Oscar® winner Colin Firth return to play Sophie’s three possible dads: Sam, Bill and Harry.\n\nAs the film goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present, James will play the role of Young Donna.  Filling the roles of Young Rosie and Young Tanya are Alexa Davies (A Brilliant Young Mind) and Jessica Keenan Wynn (Broadway’s Beautiful).  Young Sam will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), while Young Bill is Josh Dylan (Allied) and Young Harry is Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends)."

You have talked before about how Netflix won't be hurt to much by Disney taking it's properties off Netflix. But with the Disney/Fox deal it's safe to assume that a similar thing will happen with all the newly acquired Fox properties. Two major company taking content off Netflix is a lot more significant than if just one did. \n\nMelissa Ramirez  - Looks like the sequel to Alien Covenent got cancelled just like you said it would. But really, is it any surprise? The last film did so badly, why did anyone still think a new one would happen?\n\nJacob Hickey - The box office results of Blade Runner 2019 has to rank amongst the biggest cinematic disappointments of 2017. Such a great movie, such a sad result. Ridley Scott is saying that the reason is did badly was the long running time. Do you agree with him?\n\nDion Debord - Hey John. Hope you’re having a great holiday season! With the debate going on about The Last Jedi, Mark Hamill has repeatedly stated his disappointment with the film. My question is, even if all film is subjective, if Luke Skywalker himself says the movie isn’t good, how can anyone still defend it?\n\nIntothefuture - Q: I have been looking forward to the Han Solo film coming out sometime i’m 2018. I thought with Ron Howard coming in that all would be forgiven and or saved? Do you think this movie has a chance? Reports are saying Disney has no faith. This is not good to hear :("

07Um1PY_P4o,"In Theaters January 12, 2018\n\n Following the worldwide hit “Paddington,” one of the most successful family films of all time, this much-anticipated sequel finds Paddington (Ben Whishaw) happily settled with the Brown family in London, where he has become a popular member of the local community, spreading joy and marmalade wherever he goes.  \n\n While searching for the perfect present for his beloved Aunt Lucy’s hundredth birthday, Paddington sees a unique pop-up book in Mr. Gruber’s antique shop, and embarks upon a series of odd jobs to buy it.  But when the book is stolen, it’s up to Paddington and the Browns to unmask the thief.\n \n Reuniting many of the original film’s cast while welcoming those in new roles, “Paddington 2” stars Golden Globe nominee Hugh Bonneville (“Downton Abbey”), Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins (“Blue Jasmine”), three-time Golden Globe nominee Brendan Gleeson (“The Guard,” “Into the Storm,” “In Bruges”), Oscar nominee Julie Walters (“Billy Elliot,” “Educating Rita”), Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (“Iris”), and Oscar winner Peter Capaldi (short, “Franz Kafka’s It’s a Wonderful Life”), with Golden Globe and BAFTA Award winner Hugh Grant (“Four Weddings and a Funeral”), and BAFTA winner Ben Whishaw (“The Hollow Crown”) as the voice of Paddington.  The starring ensemble also includes Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, and Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (“Vera Drake”) as the voice of Aunt Lucy. \n\n Paddington’s return to the big screen was again helmed by BAFTA-nominated director Paul King (“Paddington,” “Come Fly with Me,” “The Mighty Boosh”) from a script written by King and Simon Farnaby (Sky TV’s “Yonderland,” “Mindhorn”), based on the best-selling and internationally adored books by Michael Bond, creator of Paddington Bear.  \n\n The film was produced by multiple award-winning producer David Heyman (the “Harry Potter” films, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” Oscar nominee for “Gravity”).   Serving as executive producers were Rosie Alison, Jeffrey Clifford, Alexandra Ferguson Derbyshire, Ron Halpern, and Didier Lupfer.  \n\n Creative talent returning behind the camera included director of photography Erik Alexander Wilson (“Tyrannosaur,” “Submarine”), production designer Gary Williamson (“Bunny and the Bull,” “Submarine”), Oscar-winning costume designer Lindy Hemming (“Wonder Woman,” “The Dark Knight”), and editor Mark Everson (“Mindhorn,” “Alan Partridge”), joined by editor Jonathan Amos (“Baby Driver”).  Visual effects were provided by the highly acclaimed British VFX company, Framestore, led by animation director Pablo Grillo (“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them”) and VFX supervisors Andy Kind (“Gravity”) and Glen Pratt (“Beauty and the Beast”).  The score is composed by Academy Award winner Dario Marianelli (“Atonement”).  \n\n “Paddington 2” was shot on location in and around central London, as well as on the legendary soundstages of Warner Bros. Leavesden and Pinewood film studios.\n\n Warner Bros. Pictures and STUDIOCANAL present, in association with Anton Capital Entertainment S.C.A., a Heyday Films Production, “Paddington 2.”  The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.  www.paddington.com\n\n “Paddington 2” is rated PG for some action and mild rude humor.\n\n©2017 StudioCanal S.A.S.

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com features a stable of club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, who deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.\n \nMajor League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues. The American League, originally founded in 1901, consists of the following teams: Baltimore Orioles; Boston Red Sox; Chicago White Sox; Cleveland Indians; Detroit Tigers; Houston Astros; Kansas City Royals; Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; Minnesota Twins; New York Yankees; Oakland Athletics; Seattle Mariners; Tampa Bay Rays; Texas Rangers; and Toronto Blue Jays. The National League, originally founded in 1876, consists of the following teams: Arizona Diamondbacks; Atlanta Braves; Chicago Cubs; Cincinnati Reds; Colorado Rockies; Los Angeles Dodgers; Miami Marlins; Milwaukee Brewers; New York Mets; Philadelphia Phillies; Pittsburgh Pirates; San Diego Padres; San Francisco Giants; St. Louis Cardinals; and Washington Nationals.\n \nVisit MLB.com: http://mlb.mlb.com\nSubscribe to MLB.TV: mlb.tv\nDownload MLB.com At Bat: http://mlb.mlb.com/mobile/atbat\nDownload MLB.com Ballpark: http://mlb.mlb.com/mobile/ballpark\nGet tickets: http://mlb.mlb.com/tickets\nOfficial MLB Merchandise: http://mlb.mlb.com/shop\n \nJoin the conversation!\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/mlb\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/mlb\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/mlb\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+MLB\nTumblr: http://drawntomlb.com/\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/MLBAM"

enqFulGwFYY,"Her destiny will be fulfilled. Alicia Vikander is Lara Croft. See TOMB RAIDER in cinemas this March. #TombRaider\nFacebook.com/TombRaiderMovieUK/\nTwitter.com/WarnerBrosUK\nInstagram.com/warnerbrosuk\n\nLara Croft is the fiercely independent daughter of an eccentric adventurer who vanished when she was scarcely a teen.  Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent.  Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father’s global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he’s truly gone.  Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can’t understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death.\n\nLeaving everything she knows behind, Lara goes in search of her dad’s last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan.  But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous.  Suddenly, the stakes couldn’t be higher for Lara, who—against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit—must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown.  If she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider.\n\nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, “Tomb Raider” is the story that will set a young and resolute Lara Croft on a path toward becoming a global hero.  The film stars Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (“Ex Machina,” “The Danish Girl”) in the lead role, under the direction of Roar Uthaug (“The Wave”), with Oscar-winner Graham King (“The Departed”) producing under his GK Films banner.  The executive producers are Patrick McCormick, Denis O’Sullivan and Noah Hughes.\n“Tomb Raider” also stars Dominic West (“Money Monster,” “300”), Walton Goggins (“The Hateful Eight,” “Django Unchained”), Daniel Wu (AMC’s “Into the Badlands”) and Oscar nominee Kristin Scott Thomas (“The English Patient”).\nUthaug directed from a script by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons.  The director’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography George Richmond (“Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation”); production designer Gary Freeman (“Maleficent”); Oscar-nominated editor Stuart Baird (“Skyfall,” “Gorillas in the Mist”) and editor Michael Tronick (“Suicide Squad”); Oscar-winning costume designer Colleen Atwood (“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them”) and costume designer Timothy A. Wonsik (assistant costume designer, “Free State of Jones,” “Iron Man 3”).  The music is by Tom Holkenborg (“Mad Max: Fury Road”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures present, a Square Enix production, a GK Films production, “Tomb Raider.” \n\nSet for release beginning March 16, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by MGM."

Kn5UgGQukYQ,"The Hudson Union www.hudsonunionsociety.com is where everyone comes to be inspired, to change our world.\n\nCheck us out on Twitter @ActualJoePascal\n\nBryan Cranston won four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Walter White in AMC’s Breaking Bad. He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2014 he won a Tony Award for his role as Lyndon B. Johnson in the bio-play All the Way. In film, Cranston has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and received an Academy Award nomination for his leading role in Trumbo. Among his numerous television and film appearances, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for his portrayal of Hal in FOX’s Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nBryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father, a struggling actor and director, cast him in a United Way commercial. Soon, Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boy’s destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly, destiny took a back seat to survival.\n\nSeeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Suddenly he thought: This was what he wanted to do, what he would do, with the rest of his life. Act.\n\nEach paid attendee will receive, Brian Cranston’s riveting memoir, A Life in Parts, Cranston traces his zigzag journey from his chaotic childhood to to mega-stardom and a cult-like following\n\nAt the Hudson Union with great humor, and much humility, Cranston will chronicle his unlikely rise from a soap opera regular, trying to learn the ropes and the politics of show business on the fly.  \n\nCranston will dive deep into the grittiest, most fascinating details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most riveting performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin."

No single notes. \n\nA tritone is referring to a particular musical interval (how far away two notes are from each other) and is renowned for it's dissonance and harsh feeling of tension. A tritone name refers to the 3 whole tone distance between the two notes.\n\nIt's used to great effect in a lot of different genres, but straight up 2 note only tritone chords I most closely associate with Deathcore. And I can't think of anywhere else where it's used anywhere near as often. Particular the band Oceano came to mind while writing this.\n\nIt's rumored that the tritone was banned in medieval times, that you could be jailed for using it, that people believed it could summon the devil...  None of which are actually true, but make for a great story that really fits in well with this harsh musical interval.\n\nHere's me chatting about writing this after being thrust into the underworld: https://youtu.be/651DVX5w3Ow\n\nMixed by Ryan Fluff Bruce: https://www.youtube.com/user/Fluff191\nVideo edit by Jake Jarvi: https://www.youtube.com/pineappleboyfilms/\n\nThis video was made possible because of Patreon support from Tianyu Ge, Navin Antoine, Brad Tucker, Jaz Maglana, Blayd Malburne, Andrew Johnston, Cody Melcher, Caleb Chalfin, Otto Cate, Nicolette Kawata, Tyler Feinman, Haroon Rahman, Quintin Waldner, Hypergnome, Stefan Gunn, Andy AKA VaultsOfExtoth, Rob Harper, & many other awesome people on my Patreon page: http://www.patreon.com/RobScallon\nThank you so much!\n\nMusic videos go on the main.

This is why.\n\nFollow Vox's full 2018 Winter Olympics coverage here: http://bit.ly/2nVUSz2\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIn this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the triple axel and why it's such a big deal. The figure skating jump is legendary among ice skaters, from Tonya Harding's 1991 triple axel to modern icon Mirai Nagasu's attempts in competition. It turns out that the physics of the triple axel makes it a uniquely difficult jump — and one worth learning about.\n\nAs a forward-edge jump, the mechanics of a triple axel requires technical acumen from skaters while they still try to maintain an artistically interesting performance. Pioneers like Midori Ito and Tonya Harding had to jump, ramp up rotation speed, and then land all while trying to look good. This effort set them apart from competitors like Nancy Kerrigan, but it wasn't easy to land a triple axel in competition.\n\nAnd that difficulty might be why the triple axel endures as the pinnacle of figure skating performance — and why it's sure to light up the 2018 Winter Olympics as well.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

2Cy2S6jbviQ,"STOP! First, subscribe to Alec Steele's amazing YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/user/alectheblacksmith\nCheck out the 3 videos of the plane blade being forged - https://youtu.be/017RX4U5BTI\n\nTHANK YOU TO ROCKLER FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO POSSIBLE!\n                  http://www.rockler.com\n\nLife lesson.  Never say no to Alec Steele.  He asked if I'd be interested in coming up with a collaborative project and my answer was OMG yes!  We decided to make a high angle smoother plane.   Damascus steel blade, hand forged by Alec, and the plane body, sculpted by me.  Originally there were going to be two blades and two planes, but blacksmithing is hard!  One of the blades didn't pass QC so Alec moved ahead with just the single blade. \n\nThis is a high angle smoother plane.  It is made to take thin layers of wood off of lumber to leave a super smooth surface that requires minimal sanding.  This is especially useful for highly figured wood.\n\nSpeaking of highly figured wood, the body of the plane is made out of some amazing curly walnut.  For a little extra flair, I added a paduak racing strip to the right side. The Rockler Bandy Clamps made the glue ups a breeze.\n\nHand planes are devilishly easy to make, but incredibly difficult to make right.  I did a ton of research before getting started to calculate angles, size, shape, and even materials to give myself the best chance of success.  If I someday decide this design doesn't work for me anymore, I can simply build another one.  The blade isn't going anywhere!  All the angled cuts were made on the Rockler Table Saw Sled so I could do them safely and accurately.  This is possibly my number one favourite tool from Rockler.  The sled is perfect.\n\nI roughed out the shape on the bandsaw before sculpting the shape with files, chisels and sandpaper.  The Rockler T-Track Table made this so easy since I was able to flip, rotate and adjust the placement of the plane so I could easily trim wherever I needed to.  Once I was happy with the shape and it fit my hands nicely I sanded for hours.  Every surface was sanded to 400.\n\nTo compliment the paduak stripe I chose a 1/4 copper rod instead of the more traditional brass rod.  I drilled the hole, polished the rod and hammered it home.  Friction is enough to keep it from going anywhere.  The wedge was cut from scrap and sanded to fit perfectly against the blade.  The fit of the wedge is extremly important to how well the plane performs.  \n\nAfter ensureing all parts of the plane work together perfectly I applied 2 coats of danish oil.  It gave the plane a beautiful low luster finish while bringing out the figure of the wood perfectly.  After a few weeks I will come back and give it a light waxing.  \n\nI think thats everything... Be sure to check out the 3 videos Alec made showing how the plane blade was forged.  It's incredible to watch and Alec's energy is infectious.  You will just be happy after watching.  Also a big thank you to Rockler for supporting not only me, but so many makers around the world.  \n\n===========================================\n- Instagram - http://instagram.com/dpmakestuff\n- Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/dpmakestuff\n- Plans - http://www.dpmakestuff.com\n\n===========================================\n= Links To Tools Used =\n\nTape Cutter:  http://amzn.to/2wExKdG\nTable Saw Sled: http://shrsl.com/r87s\nBandy Clamps: http://shrsl.com/r87v\nT-Track Table: http://shrsl.com/r88e\nFlexcut Chisels: http://shrsl.com/r88f\nSilicon Mat: http://amzn.to/2FldFL4\nGlue Brush: http://amzn.to/2EgCgBp\nDanish Oil: http://amzn.to/2EdW3kW\nWooden Mallet:  http://amzn.to/2gLRJ4I\nRuler:  http://amzn.to/2bOARY4\nTitebond Glue:  http://amzn.to/1TmiBAs\nChisels:  http://amzn.to/2w5fKpm\nForstner Drill Bits:  http://amzn.to/2bRDTMk\nF Clamps:  http://amzn.to/2gL4lJy\n\n===========================================\n\n= Bookmark these to support the channel =\n- Amazon - http://amzn.to/2ezs5zq\n- Amazon Canada - http://amzn.to/2vVrz1m\n\n===========================================\n\n= Shop Equipment =\nRockler Stuff:  http://amzn.to/2bYUGJf\nSaw Stop:  http://amzn.to/2ctLWdP\nBand Saw:  http://amzn.to/2c72OZN\nLathe:  http://amzn.to/2e9IjMN\nX Carve CNC:  https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve\n\n===========================================\nFeeling like sending me a letter, stickers or crisp 100 dollar bill?

Jerusalem is home to important holy sites for all the Abrahamic religions, and so it has become a critical bargaining chip in the ongoing discussion between Israelis and Palestinians. \n\nPresident Trump's administration announced in 2017 that it would officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and that it planned to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. This would make the U.S. the only country in the world with an embassy to Israel in Jerusalem - there are currently various consulates, but no embassies. The announcement spurred condemnation from various countries, including U.S. allies, and has quickly become a political flashpoint of the Middle East.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

RF-Mqs2qC-M,"In this episode of Open Door, Grammy-winning record producer and DJ Zedd gives an in-depth tour of his $16 million mansion in Benedict Canyon, an area of Los Angeles that's near Sherman Oaks and northwest of Beverly Hills. Zedd's self-decorated home is 9,500 square feet with views of the canyon and tons of full-length glass windows. \n\nThe house is structured into three sections: work, living, and sleep. The work section has Zedd's recording studio and an unfinished gym.\n\nThe driveway leads into the front entrance, which crosses a moat. \n\nA huge wall with cubbies holds art, awards, and silly memorabilia. For instance, Zedd's Grammy sits next to a poop emoji.\n\nAt the end of a corridor, before going outside, guests can pick their favorite flavor of the rainbow from the Skittles machine. \n\nZedd also has a server room and a Costco Room that contains just about anything he would need if he weren't able to leave the house for a long time.\n\nThe bathrooms feature automated blinds that can sometimes surprise the person taking the shower early in the morning.\n\nThe remote-controlled curtains in Zedd's bedroom make him the happiest of any feature in the house.\n\nOutside, the pool has a hidden jacuzzi / hot tub that's revealed when the pool's water level drops.\n\nThe kitchen has four built-in hibachi grills, a pot filler above the stovetop (which Zedd says is the reason he bought the house), and built-in vacuums.  \n\nStill haven’t subscribed to Architectural Digest on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/2zl7s34\n\nABOUT ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST\nThe leading international design authority, Architectural Digest features articles and videos of the best in architecture, style, culture, travel, and shopping.\n\nInside Zedd's $16 Million Mansion That Has a Skittles Machine | Open Door | Architectural Digest"

The burial site lies in a village that existed long before the Aztecs, in the southern part of what is now Mexico City. Bodies had one arm placed below the back of the next in the six-foot-wide round pit. Some bodies show aesthetic modification—dental filing and head reshaping. Some hold stones or ceramic spheres. The arrangement of the dead implies a single event, not a buildup of remains. The nature of that event is a mystery.\n\nRead Interlocked Skeletons Found at Pre-Aztec Burial Site\nhttp://bit.ly/2nwQVBB\n\nPre-Aztec Skeletons Found Arranged in Spiral Shape | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/6UPeSHu1u_w\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo"

Next Independence Day, witness the rise of our country’s 12 hours of annual lawlessness.  Welcome to the movement that began as a simple experiment: The First Purge.\n \nTo push the crime rate below one percent for the rest of the year, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) test a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community.  But when the violence of oppressors meets the rage of the marginalized, the contagion will explode from the trial-city borders and spread across the nation.\n\nComing off the most successful film in the series, The Purge: Election Year, creator James DeMonaco (writer/director of The Purge, The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year) returns alongside the producers of this worldwide phenomenon: Blumhouse Productions’ Jason Blum (Insidious series, Get Out, Split), Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ouija series, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and DeMonaco’s longtime production partner, Sébastien K. Lemercier (Assault on Precinct 13, Four Lovers).  \n\nThe First Purge is directed by Gerard McMurray (Burning Sands), working from a screenplay once again written by DeMonaco.  www.thefirstpurge.com"

GStMSkhmYEs,"AMAZING Indian Street Food TOUR in Punjab, India! It has some of the Best Street Food in INDIA, it's a TRUE curry HEAVEN! We travel in India for street food, and went on a DEEP Street Food TOUR in Amritsar PUNJAB, to try some of the most AMAZING street food around the world! The Food Ranger (Trevor James) is in India eating Street Food! This truly was an amazing STREET FOOD ADVENTURE in INDIA with AMAZING curry, breakfast, and delicious restaurants with UNIQUE Indian food recipes and Indian dinner!\n\nIf you love eating street food around the world and street food in India, or even all over Asia, you will love the street food in Amritsar. You can find street food everywhere, where everyone seems to cook delicious Indian recipes for curry and SPICY dishes all over the street.\n\nIn one day, we had 7 delicious street foods all made in the PUNJAB style. I didn’t realize until after we finished eating, but we didn’t eat any meat or chicken at all! It was true vegetarian HEAVEN!\n\nWe started out the day with an AMAZING Indian breakfast in two different Indian street food restaurants. The first was the famous Amritsar Kulcha. I’m pretty sure you can get this dish in Delhi, but here in Amritsar is the origin of this stuffed baked bread from HEAVEN. It’s stuffed with a spiced potato mix and onions. It’s sprinkled with a masala spice and then put DEEP into the Tandoori oven and baked. It’s served to you on a plate with Chole chickpea curry and onion chutney.\n\nThe next AMAZING Breakfast we had on our street food tour was the Poori and Chole with Potato sabzi. A little similar with the chole, but the potato sabzi was nice and sweet and tangy and very UNIQUE!\n\nAfterwards, we took our TUK TUK around town for some more amazing street foods.  We enjoyed a street corner tofu curry served with a pancake and then we went to have a sweet and sour buttermilk lassi.\n\nAfter this, we went to the LEGENDARY Kesar De Dhaba all vegetarian curry restaurant that uses PURE desi ghee. It was extremely flavourful and just a little spicy. We ordered the VEG thali and it was incredible! The paratha bread was so fluffy and covered in pure desi ghee, absolute HEAVEN! We also ate some dessert, a fruit kulfi ice cream!\n\nAfter this we went for a couple more street foods in Amritsar. We were exploring the back lanes and found an amazing mango fruit stall! It was dried and covered in a slightly spicy and sour and tangy sauce. There were a lot of flavours in this Indian recipe. It was spicy, sour, tangy, sweet, peppery, acidic, pungent, and made your mouth pucker when you ate it! Very UNIQUE!\n\nAfter this, we went for our final street food, an ICONIC street food in India, the samosa. It was stuffed with potato, cumin seeds, and spices.\n\nThe addresses for these street food restaurants in Amritsar, India, are listed below:\n\n1) Breakfast Street Food Kulcha at Monu Kulcha Hut\nGali No, 10, Loharka Road, Ranjit Vihar, N.R.I. Colony, NRI Colony, Gumtala, Amritsar, Punjab 143001, India\n2) Amazing Poori and Chole and desserts at Kanha Sweets\nShop 1, Opposite Bijli Pehalwan Mandir, Lawrence Road, White Avenue, Amritsar\n3) Fairly OK veg curry DEEP in the back lanes of Amritsar (honestly can’t remember this address, go for the Kesar De Dhaba instead).\n4) Delicious Street Lassi at Ahuja Lassi\nNear Hindu College, Amritsar, India\n5) BEST Vegetarian Curry in the WORLD @ Kesar De Dhaba, Amritsar\n6) Amazing Mango sour and spicy dessert at Aam Papad:\nRam lubhaya and sons\n7) Potato Samosa at Raam samosey wala\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n\n My name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious . I enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way! Over the next few years, I'm going to travel around the world and document as much food as I can for you! I love delicious food!

Check out his website: http://wolfgangpuck.com/\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nSalmon with Pesto Veggie Noodles by Wolfgang Puck\nServings: 2\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 shallot\n2 cloves garlic\n5 large leaves basil\n¼ bunch flat leaf parsley\n1 pint cherry tomatoes\n1 teaspoon chili flakes\nSalt, to taste\nPepper, to taste\n1 lemon\n¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for cooking\n2 6-ounce fillets of salmon, skin off\n1 yellow squash\n1 zucchini\n2 carrots\n2 watermelon radishes\n\nPREPARATION\nFinely dice the shallot and add it to a medium bowl. \nMince the garlic and add it to the bowl with the shallot. \nChiffonade the basil, chop the parsley, and add to the bowl. \nQuarter the cherry tomatoes and add them to the bowl with the herbs, along with the chili flakes, a pinch of salt and pepper, the juice of one lemon, and the olive oil. Stir to combine.\nHeat a bit of oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. \nSeason the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. When the oil is shimmering, sear the salmon on one side until golden brown. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown and the fish is cooked through. Remove the salmon from the heat and wipe out the skillet.\nCut the squash, zucchini, carrots, and watermelon radishes in half, if needed, then spiralize.\nHeat a bit of oil in the pan over medium heat until simmering. \nAdd the vegetable noodles to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Saute until tender, about 2 minutes. \nDivide the vegetable noodles between two plates. \nPlace a piece of salmon on each bed of noodles, then top with tomato sauce.\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nWolfgang Puck's Trout in Puff Pastry\nServings: 6\n\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n½ cup celery, sliced \n½ cup leeks, julienned\n½ cup carrots, julienned\nSalt, to taste\nWhite pepper, to taste\n1 cup heavy cream\n1 whole trout, cleaned\nBlack pepper, to taste\n2 tablespoons fresh tarragon, chopped\n2 sheets puff pastry\n2 eggs, beaten\nParsley, for serving\nLemon wedges, for serving\n\nChive Butter Sauce:\n1 cup white wine\nJuice of one lemon\n4 shallots, minced\n½ bunch tarragon \n1 cup heavy cream\n18 tablespoons (2 ¼ sticks) butter, sliced\nSalt, to taste\nPepper, to taste\n2 bunches chives, minced\n \nPREPARATION\nHeat the olive oil in a medium pan over medium heat. \nAdd the celery, leeks, carrots, and a pinch of salt and white pepper, and sauté until the vegetables start to cook down. \nAdd the cream and stir to coat the vegetables. Cook until the cream is thickened.\nRemove the pan from the heat.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out both sheets of puff pastry until they are ⅓-inch thick. Transfer one sheet of puff pastry to the baking sheet.\nCut the trout along the back to remove the spine, then butterfly open. Season with salt, pepper, and the tarragon. \nScoop the cooked vegetables onto one side of the fish, then fold over the other fillet. \nTransfer the fish to the center of the sheet of puff pastry. \nBrush egg wash around the fish, then lay on the second sheet of puff pastry, pressing around the fish to seal. Use a paring knife to cut away the excess puff pastry in the shape of a fish. \nBrush the top of the puff pastry with egg wash and use the leftover pastry scraps to decorate the fish with an eye and gills. Use the tip of the knife or the large opening of a pastry tip to draw scales on the body and tail. \nChill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.\nMake the Chive Butter Sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the wine, lemon juice, shallots, and tarragon.

O fato realmente aconteceu no Recanto Ecológico Rio da Prata (Jardim-MS) no dia 02 de fevereiro e foi registrado durante o monitoramento realizado pelo colaborador do passeio, Waldemilson Vera.\n\nQuando chove muito, o rio da Prata corre de forma mais lenta, ocasionando seu represamento, aumentando assim o nível de água do rio Olho D'Água.\n\nApesar da cheia, no dia em que o vídeo foi gravado as águas do rio Olho D'Água continuaram cristalinas devido a sua mata ciliar conservada e por estar dentro de uma Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural - RPPN, um tipo de Unidade de Conservação.\n\nEste foi um episódio raro, e, ao final do dia, o rio já havia voltado ao seu nível normal.\n\nInformamos que nesta data o passeio operou normalmente até o 1º trecho que, apesar de estar também com nível d'água acima do normal, todos os turistas saíram satisfeitos por terem vivenciado um dia diferente e especial no atrativo!\n\nFaced with the repercussion of the video released on February 15, in social networks, which appears a submerged track, we wanted to pass some clarification. The fact really happened at the Rio de Prata Ecological Recanto (Jardim-MS) on February 02 and was recorded during the monitoring carried out by Waldemilson Vera.\n\nWhen it rains a lot, the Rio da Prata river runs of slower form, causing its damming, thus increasing the water level of the Olho D'Água river.\n\nDespite the flood, on the day the video was recorded the waters of the Olho D'Agua river remained crystal clear due to their conserved riparian forest and being inside a Private Reserve of the Natural Patrimony - PRNP, a type of Conservation Unit.\n\nThis was a rare episode, and by the end of the day the river had returned to its normal level.\n\nWe would like to inform that on this date the tour operated normally until the 1st stretch, which, although it is also above normal, all the tourists left satisfied because they experienced a different and special day in the attraction!"

aBQDFQwfX2w,"What would bring together the hyper-competitive people from Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest during the holidays? A good old-fashioned a cappella sing-off, that’s what. In late November the San Francisco Conservatory of Music hosted the fifth annual installment of “Techapella,”a showcase for the a cappella singing clubs of some of the most powerful companies in the world.\n\nThe event was founded by Laolee Xiong, a security specialist at Facebook. It was initially a way to have a competition with his friends who sang in Google’s group, “Googapella.” Then he mentioned it to his friend at Google and suggested that they do “some kind of Pitch Perfect-style sing-off,” said Xiong.\n\nAfter an informal singing battle at each of the tech giant’s campuses, the a cappella groups from other companies (Twitter has “The Song Birds” and Pinterest has “the Pintunes”) reached out to Xiong to organize a larger event, and “Techapella” was born. More than 1,500 fans attended the two-night event.\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo"

It hits theaters on May 25th.\n\nParamount Pictures and Skydance released the first Mission: Impossible Fallout trailer, teased first during the Super Bowl, then dropping the full length online soon after. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie marks the first director in the franchise to repeat after Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation. \n\nBOX OFFICE REPORT  \n\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom dropped its Superbowl trailer offering an extended look at the upcoming movie. The sequel finds Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly reprising their roles as screenwriters, with A Monster Calls and The Impossible filmmaker J.A. Bayona taking over directing duties. \n\nUniversal Pictures unveiled the first trailer for Skyscraper on Super Bowl Sunday. The film is based on an original idea by writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber (We’re the Millers) and stars Dwayne Johnson as a former FBI Hostage Rescue Team leader who now assesses security for skyscrapers. \n\nThe first trailer for Cloverfield 3, now officially title The Cloverfield Paradox, has been released online, along with major news — it landed on Netflix right after the Superbowl.

This comes as Warner Bros. begins reshuffling its D.C. properties, with New Line exec Walter Hamada recently promoted to oversee its comic book movies. \n\nDisney has released the first official synopsis for Solo: A Star Wars Story, the major new Star Wars movie that’s coming out in a little over four months. As part of Disney’s 2018 preview kit, the synopsis seems to tease the release of the first trailer, which should be coming any day now.\n\nAGREE OR DISAGREE\n\nAmazon Studios has released the first trailer for Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot. Written and directed by Gus Van Sant, the film is based on the memoir of the same name by cartoonist, artist, and musician John Callahan. Joaquin Phoenix plays Callahan, who becomes a quadriplegic in a car accident at the age of 21 after a day of drinking. \n\nYesterday, Disney released its 2018 preview kit teasing their upcoming slate of films and inside featured the first official look at Hope Van Dyne alongside Scott Lang in Marvel’s upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly reprise their roles in the movie alongside Michael Peña and Michael Douglas, that will also introduce Hope’s mother, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. \n\n20th Century Fox has released a new trailer for Love, Simon. Based on Becky Albertalli’s novel, Greg Berlanti’s film follows seventeen-year-old Simon Spier (Nick Robinson), who is currently grappling with how to tell his family and friends that he’s gay while also working to identify an anonymous classmate he’s fallen for online. The film is set for release on March 16th. \n\nMAIL BAG \n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Jay: https://twitter.com/MrJayWashington\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

b33PN2NB2Do,"Until the Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, the Green Book was critical for black Americans wanting to travel across the country. \n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nRoad tripping in the 20th century became an iconic American obsession, and the rising middle class was eager to travel the country on the new interstate highway system. The Green Book was a unique travel guide during this time, when segregation was practiced all over the country.\n\nThe book, which grew to cover locations in all 50 states, listed hotels, restaurants, gas stations, beauty salons, and other services that would reliably serve African Americans. The listings grew from user correspondence and a network of African American postal workers under the guidance of Victor Hugo Green, the book’s publisher.\n\nThe American road trip would go on to be an anchor in the civil rights discussion, as it highlighted the injustices and prejudice that African Americans suffered under Jim Crow. Before the Civil Rights Act outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations, Victor Green’s booklet helped black Americans navigate their country. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

jiP82WVx6mM,"Michael Mosley, author of the 5:2 diet and the Clever Guts Diet, spoke to Business Insider UK and explained why a healthy diet is much more important than exercise when it comes to losing weight. \n\nMosley said, An awful lot of people go to the gym in January in order to lose weight. They think if they go to the gym and cycle a bit and do a bit of running then they will obviously shed some of those kilos. The reality is that that does not happen which is why the vast majority of people give up.\n\nIn order to lose a kilo of fat you would probably have to run two marathons. So in many ways it is obviously much easier simply to reduce the amount of calories you eat rather than trying to run them off because you have to do so much exercise to burn calories.\n\nWhat I would recommend is yes, you do exercise because that’s going to improve your mood and it’s very helpful once you’ve lost weight but hoping that simply by doing exercise you’re going to lose weight is really over optimistic.\n\nYou should be aware of these tendencies but as I said if you really want to lose weight the only way to do that is by reducing the calories you eat and switching the sort of food you eat.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­­----------\n\nFollow BI UK on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1Nz3jG3\nFollow BI UK on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1VWDkiy\nFollow BI UK on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2gsLEds\nRead more on BI UK: uk.businessinsider.com\n\n----------------------------------------­­­­----------\n\nBusiness Insider UK is the largest business news site for British readers and viewers in the UK.

And something that was really special was the Professor Slughorn chair prop.

Uchida, a third-generation Japanese-American living in Hilo, Hawaii, inherited her grandmother's mochi recipe and evolved it to include the colors and eclectic tastes of her beloved state.

Our childhoods, even the apparently benign ones, leave us no option but to be anything else.\nAs a result of these childhoods, we tend, over most issues, to list – like a sailing yacht in high wind – far too much in one direction or another. We are too timid, or too assertive; too rigid or too accommodating; too focused on material success or excessively lackadaisical. We are obsessively eager around sex or painfully wary and nervous in the face of our own erotic impulses. We are dreamily naive or sourly down to earth; we recoil from risk or embrace it recklessly; we have emerged into adult life determined never to rely on anyone or as desperate for another to complete us; we are overly intellectual or unduly resistant to ideas. The encyclopedia of emotional imbalances is a volume without end. What is certain is that these imbalances come at a huge cost, rendering us less able to exploit our talents and opportunities, less able to lead satisfying lives and a great deal less fun to be around…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects on our blog, here: https://goo.gl/6ubziU\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nVisit us in person at our London HQ: https://goo.gl/qf1h3j\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nYou can submit translations and transcripts on all of our videos here: https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&tab=2 \nFind out how more here: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB \n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nDownload our App: https://goo.gl/b7FNXL\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nDirected by: Hannah & Martha \n\nDesign: Hannah McNally\n\nAnimation Team: Flora Caulton, Emily Downe, Martha Halliday, Hannah McNally, Kathrin Steinbacher \n\nwww.hannahandmartha.com\n\nwww.floracaulton.co.uk\n\nwww.emilydowne.co.uk\n\nwww.kathrinsteinbacher.com"

2Cy2S6jbviQ,"STOP! First, subscribe to Alec Steele's amazing YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/user/alectheblacksmith\nCheck out the 3 videos of the plane blade being forged - https://youtu.be/017RX4U5BTI\n\nTHANK YOU TO ROCKLER FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO POSSIBLE!\n                  http://www.rockler.com\n\nLife lesson.  Never say no to Alec Steele.  He asked if I'd be interested in coming up with a collaborative project and my answer was OMG yes!  We decided to make a high angle smoother plane.   Damascus steel blade, hand forged by Alec, and the plane body, sculpted by me.  Originally there were going to be two blades and two planes, but blacksmithing is hard!  One of the blades didn't pass QC so Alec moved ahead with just the single blade. \n\nThis is a high angle smoother plane.  It is made to take thin layers of wood off of lumber to leave a super smooth surface that requires minimal sanding.  This is especially useful for highly figured wood.\n\nSpeaking of highly figured wood, the body of the plane is made out of some amazing curly walnut.  For a little extra flair, I added a paduak racing strip to the right side. The Rockler Bandy Clamps made the glue ups a breeze.\n\nHand planes are devilishly easy to make, but incredibly difficult to make right.  I did a ton of research before getting started to calculate angles, size, shape, and even materials to give myself the best chance of success.  If I someday decide this design doesn't work for me anymore, I can simply build another one.  The blade isn't going anywhere!  All the angled cuts were made on the Rockler Table Saw Sled so I could do them safely and accurately.  This is possibly my number one favourite tool from Rockler.  The sled is perfect.\n\nI roughed out the shape on the bandsaw before sculpting the shape with files, chisels and sandpaper.  The Rockler T-Track Table made this so easy since I was able to flip, rotate and adjust the placement of the plane so I could easily trim wherever I needed to.  Once I was happy with the shape and it fit my hands nicely I sanded for hours.  Every surface was sanded to 400.\n\nTo compliment the paduak stripe I chose a 1/4 copper rod instead of the more traditional brass rod.  I drilled the hole, polished the rod and hammered it home.  Friction is enough to keep it from going anywhere.  The wedge was cut from scrap and sanded to fit perfectly against the blade.  The fit of the wedge is extremly important to how well the plane performs.  \n\nAfter ensureing all parts of the plane work together perfectly I applied 2 coats of danish oil.  It gave the plane a beautiful low luster finish while bringing out the figure of the wood perfectly.  After a few weeks I will come back and give it a light waxing.  \n\nI think thats everything... Be sure to check out the 3 videos Alec made showing how the plane blade was forged.  It's incredible to watch and Alec's energy is infectious.  You will just be happy after watching.  Also a big thank you to Rockler for supporting not only me, but so many makers around the world.  \n\n===========================================\n- Instagram - http://instagram.com/dpmakestuff\n- Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/dpmakestuff\n- Plans - http://www.dpmakestuff.com\n\n===========================================\n= Links To Tools Used =\n\nTape Cutter:  http://amzn.to/2wExKdG\nTable Saw Sled: http://shrsl.com/r87s\nBandy Clamps: http://shrsl.com/r87v\nT-Track Table: http://shrsl.com/r88e\nFlexcut Chisels: http://shrsl.com/r88f\nSilicon Mat: http://amzn.to/2FldFL4\nGlue Brush: http://amzn.to/2EgCgBp\nDanish Oil: http://amzn.to/2EdW3kW\nWooden Mallet:  http://amzn.to/2gLRJ4I\nRuler:  http://amzn.to/2bOARY4\nTitebond Glue:  http://amzn.to/1TmiBAs\nChisels:  http://amzn.to/2w5fKpm\nForstner Drill Bits:  http://amzn.to/2bRDTMk\nF Clamps:  http://amzn.to/2gL4lJy\n\n===========================================\n\n= Bookmark these to support the channel =\n- Amazon - http://amzn.to/2ezs5zq\n- Amazon Canada - http://amzn.to/2vVrz1m\n\n===========================================\n\n= Shop Equipment =\nRockler Stuff:  http://amzn.to/2bYUGJf\nSaw Stop:  http://amzn.to/2ctLWdP\nBand Saw:  http://amzn.to/2c72OZN\nLathe:  http://amzn.to/2e9IjMN\nX Carve CNC:  https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve\n\n===========================================\nFeeling like sending me a letter, stickers or crisp 100 dollar bill?

X_tYrnv_o6A,"These are the molecular machines inside your body that make cell division possible. Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‘legs’ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno"

9ZrAjnPHzjQ,"Made this printer out of a scanner, CD-ROM drive, mechanical hard drive, Arduino Duemilanove, Meccano, three motor driver boards, and a pencil.\n\nI use a point cloud software called CloudCompare to convert image data into a raster, and then export it as an ascii text file containing x,y,z,color values. Z is obviously always zero and is ignored. A value that isn't white for color tells the printer to smash the pencil (black and white only). X and y values are used to articulate the mechanisms. The reason I process the images this way is because it's just easier for me than figuring out how to read image files in Arduino code.\n\nTo print, the ascii text file is streamed over the usb serial connection to the Arduino via HyperTerminal (using XON/XOFF for flow control). Print resolution / size is 255 pixels wide by however long the scanner bed is.\n\nI believe it could also be useful in the kitchen for chopping vegetables."

After meeting an idealistic young vicar's son bent on changing society, he and Belle help shape Lord Mansfield's role as Lord Chief Justice to end slavery in England."

Henson—whose roles include bad-b*tch extraordinaire Cookie Lyon on Empire—becomes the first brave celebrity to battle the all-new wings of death. But not everything goes according to plan: After breaking down her Mary J. Blige–approved chili recipe and explaining what Cookie would make of Cardi B, Taraji pulls one of the most unorthodox moves in Hot Ones history, calling in some extra muscle—and a little whiskey—to tame the rising flames. \n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect."
Nz0qoOgyWSQ,"Paper Magazine debuted a racy cover featuring Nicki Minaj. Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her. Go women in hip hop. It's not my thing. I just don't think it's right.\n\nSubscribe To The Talk Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/10hBiIw\nWatch Full Episodes of The Talk HERE: http://bit.ly/Wz3H0U\nFollow “The Talk” on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1OLLdk1\nLike The Talk on Facebook HERE: http://on.fb.me/12v9WlC\nFollow “The Talk” on Instagram HERE: http://bit.ly/1hggnWc\nFollow The Talk on Google+ HERE: http://bit.ly/1SOobzn\n\nGet the CBS app for iPhone & iPad!

ajh-Gn-2wWo,"Occurred on November 22, 2017 / Heath, Ohio, USA\n\nWe went through the Burger King drive-through around 8 in the morning to get breakfast. after I ordered one item, the lady on the microphone gave me my total. I told her that I wasn't finished ordering and she told me to hurry up. I turned into the parking lot to go inside and let the manager know how the lady at the microphone was acting. I then found out that the woman on the microphone was the manager herself. She told us to get out of her store if we didn't like it. She was causing a huge scene. She threatened to call the cops but never did and we believe it is because she knew she was in the wrong. I started recording her so the police if they were called, they could see how she was acting. There was absolutely no one behind us in line at the drive-thru and no one inside at all. We left after her refusing to give us her name to report her. We then called corporate about our experience.\n\nTO SEE THE HOTTEST VIRAL VIDEOS DAILY...\nSubscribe to us on YouTube: https://goo.gl/A0gBKk\nLike us on Facebook: https://goo.gl/XQWqJt\nFollow us on Instagram: https://goo.gl/NMq8dl\nFollow us on Twitter: https://goo.gl/pF8Xop\n\nViralHog is the resource for the best viral content.  \nSubmit your own great video and make money: https://goo.gl/yejGkm\n\nContact licensing@viralhog.com to license this or any ViralHog video."

Facing environmental disasters and a plunging birthrate, Gilead is ruled by a twisted fundamentalism in its militarized ‘return to traditional values'. As one of the few remaining fertile women, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) is a Handmaid in the Commander’s household, one of the caste of women forced into sexual servitude as a last desperate attempt to repopulate the world. In this terrifying society, Offred must navigate between Commanders, their cruel Wives, domestic Marthas, and her fellow Handmaids – where anyone could be a spy for Gilead – all with one goal: to survive and find the daughter that was taken from her."

_IoOJu2_FKE,"Why can't you just flick a tick? Because it attaches to you with a mouth covered in hooks, while it fattens up on your blood. For days. But don't worry – there *is* a way to pull it out.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt \n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world.  Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\nSpring is here. Unfortunately for hikers and picnickers out enjoying the warmer weather, the new season is prime time for ticks, which can transmit bacteria that cause Lyme disease. \n\nHow they latch on – and stay on – is a feat of engineering that scientists have been piecing together. Once you know how a tick’s mouth works, you understand why it’s impossible to simply flick a tick. \n\nThe key to their success is a menacing mouth covered in hooks that they use to get under the surface of our skin and attach themselves for several days while they fatten up on our blood.\n\n“Ticks have a lovely, evolved mouth part for doing exactly what they need to do, which is extended feeding,” said Kerry Padgett, supervising public health biologist at the California Department of Public Health in Richmond. “They're not like a mosquito that can just put their mouth parts in and out nicely, like a hypodermic needle.”\n\nInstead, a tick digs in using two sets of hooks. Each set looks like a hand with three hooked fingers. The hooks dig in and wriggle into the skin. Then these “hands” bend in unison to perform approximately half-a-dozen breaststrokes that pull skin out of the way so the tick can push in a long stubby part called the hypostome.\n\n“It’s almost like swimming into the skin,” said Dania Richter, a biologist at the Technische Universität in Braunschweig, Germany, who has studied the mechanism closely. “By bending the hooks it’s engaging the skin. It’s pulling the skin when it retracts.”\n\nThe bottom of their long hypostome is also covered in rows of hooks that give it the look of a chainsaw. Those hooks act like mini-harpoons, anchoring the tick to us for the long haul.\n\n“They’re teeth that are backwards facing, similar to one of those gates you would drive over but you're not allowed to back up or else you'd puncture your tires,” said Padgett.\n\n--- How to remove a tick.\nKerry Padgett, at the California Department of Public Health, recommends grabbing the tick close to the skin using a pair of fine tweezers and simply pulling straight up.\n\n“No twisting or jerking,” she said. “Use a smooth motion pulling up.”\n\nPadgett warned against using other strategies.    \n\n“Don't use Vaseline or try to burn the tick or use a cotton swab soaked in soft soap or any of these other techniques that might take a little longer or might not work at all,” she said. “You really want to remove the tick as soon as possible.”\n\n---  What happens if the mouth of a tick breaks off in your skin?\nDon’t worry if the tick’s mouth parts stay behind when you pull. \n\n“The mouth parts are not going to transmit disease to people,” said Padgett. \n\nIf the mouth stayed behind in your skin, it will eventually work its way out, sort of like a splinter does, she said. Clean the bite area with soap and water and apply antibiotic ointment.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: https://www.kqed.org/science/1920972/how-ticks-dig-in-with-a-mouth-full-of-hooks\n\n---+ For more information: \nCenters for Disease Control information on Lyme disease:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/lyme/\n\nMosquito & Vector Control District for San Mateo County, California:\nhttps://www.smcmvcd.org/ticks\n\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes: \n\nHow Mosquitoes Use Six Needles to Suck Your Blood\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8SmacBUcU\n\nSo … Sometimes Fireflies Eat Other Fireflies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWdCMFvgFbo\n\nMeet the Dust Mites, Tiny Roommates That Feast On Your Skin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACrLMtPyRM0\n\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios! \n\nAbove the Noise: Are Energy Drinks Really that Bad?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l0cjsZS-eM\n\nIt’s Okay To Be Smart: Inside an ICE CAVE! - Nature's Most Beautiful Blue\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7LKm9jtm8I\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science: \nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science \nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience \n\n---+ About KQED \nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media. \n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

Bn02bclCu5A,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday, December 19th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, Perri Nemiroff, Ashley Mova discuss the following:  \n\n1) J.J. Abrams Just Pitched His Star Wars: Episode IX to Disney\n\n2) Third ‘GI Joe’ Gets Official 2020 Release Date; Paramount also dates Micronauts and Dungeons & Dragons\n\n3) Opening This Week – Pitch Perfect 3\n\n4) Director Matthew Vaughn Confirms Talks with DC\n\n“I do love the world of DC, and I’ve been talking to them at the moment about a few things. It’s more fun getting involved with franchises when they’re on the down, because then it’s easier to make a good film. So if I got involved with a few of the superhero films out there that have been disappointing, it’s going to be… if I do OK, it’ll probably be better.”\n\n5) First ‘Ocean’s 8′ Trailer \n\n6) Mail Bag\n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nJust as Star Wars The Last Jedi was gearing up to debut in theatres, work on Episode 9 started its journey into pre-production. Via a report from Making Star Wars, during the press conference for the recent Disney/Fox merger, Disney CEO Bob Iger revealed that JJ Abrams would be pitching his Star Wars to the studio on December 15th, the day The Last Jedi hit theatres. Fantha Tracks also revealed that Abrams’ film would be made with the working title “Black Diamond.” The working title for Force Awakens was “AVCO” and “Space Bear” for Last Jedi. Star Wars Episode 9 is scheduled to hit theatres on December 20th, 2019. \n\nYesterday, Paramount Pictures officially announced plans for a third GI Joe movie and dated it to be released on March 27, 2020. Titled simply GI Joe, the plan for the movie is unknown at this time, as is casting and who will be taking on directing duties. Paramount also dated a feature adaptation of the late ’70s Mego/Takara toyline Micronauts for Oct. 16, 2020, with J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot behind the production. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a recent podcast from IGN UK, director Matthew Vaughn confirmed he’s had talks with DC and is interested in helping out the studio after the not-so-stellar performance of Justice League cast more speculation as to what is happening behind closed doors over at DC. \n\nWarner Bros. has released the first Ocean’s 8 trailer for the upcoming spinoff from Steven Soderbergh’s Ocean’s trilogy. Hunger Games filmmaker Gary Ross directs the new film, which stars Sandra Bullock as Debbie Ocean, the sister of George Clooney’s Danny Ocean. When this film begins she’s fresh out of prison and assembles a team of her own to pull off a unique heist at the Met Gala. Ocean’s 8 opens in theaters on June 8, 2018.\n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Perri: https://twitter.com/PNemiroff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

But he knows they’re coming…and he’s ready.  \n\nBased on a true story, the New Line Cinema comedy “Tag” shows how far some guys will go to be the last man standing.\n\n“Tag” is directed by Jeff Tomsic (Comedy Central’s “Broad City”), with a starring ensemble cast led by Ed Helms (The “Hangover” movies, “We’re the Millers”), Jake Johnson (TV’s “New Girl”), Annabelle Wallis (“The Mummy”), Rashida Jones (TV’s “Parks and Recreation”), Isla Fisher (“Now You See Me”), Leslie Bibb (“Iron Man 2”), Hannibal Buress (“Neighbors”), with Jon Hamm (“Baby Driver,” TV’s “Mad Men”) and Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner (“The Hurt Locker,” “The Town”).  \nThe “Tag” screenplay was written by Rob McKittrick (“Waiting”) and Mark Steilen (TV’s “Mozart in the Jungle”), screen story by Mark Steilen, and based on the Wall Street Journal article entitled “It Takes Planning, Caution to Avoid Being It,” by Russell Adams.  The film is produced by Todd Garner and Mark Steilen, with Hans Ritter, Richard Brener, Walter Hamada and Dave Neustadter serving as executive producers.\n\nThe creative filmmaking team includes director of photography Larry Blanford, production designer David Sandefur, editor Josh Crockett, and costume designer Denise Wingate.  \n\n“Tag” is set for a June 15, 2018, release.  \n\nA New Line Cinema presentation of a Broken Road Production, “Tag” will be distributed by Warner Bros.

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from our online shop! - https://shop.simonscat.com/"
A0FZIwabctw,"When Falcon Heavy lifted off, it became the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two.  With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost.\n\nFollowing liftoff, the two side boosters separated from the center core and returned to landing site for future reuse.  \n\nFalcon Heavy put a Tesla Roadster and its passenger, Starman, into orbit around the sun. At max velocity Starman and the Roadster will travel 11 km/s (7mi/s) and travel 400 million km (250 million mi) from Earth."

D grows up under the wing of a Kingston Don and music producer named King Fox (Sheldon Shepherd). Fox dispatches him to London, where he reconnects with his childhood sweetheart, Yvonne (Shantol Jackson), and his daughter who he's not seen since she was a baby. He also hooks up with a soundclash crew, called High Noon. But before he can be convinced to abandon his life of crime and follow the righteous path, he encounters the man who shot his brother 10 years earlier, and embarks on a bloody, explosive quest for retribution - a quest which brings him into conflict with vicious London gangster Rico (Stephen Graham).\n\nFollow the Yardie film channels for more updates:\n\nfacebook.com/YardieFilm \ntwitter.com/YardieFilm\ninstagram.com/YardieFilm"

VvEGctiW7io,"Sansa Stark is a redhead. Other than that brief period on Game of Thrones when she dyed her hair black, the lady of Winterfell never strays from her signature red color. But the actress that plays her, Sophie Turner, is far more experimental. She's dyed her hair from blonde to red and back again more times than she'd like to recall. Turner's also been the face of haircare brand Wella Professionals since June 2017, so it's safe to say she knows a thing or two about good hair.\nOf all the hairstyles on Game of Thrones, braids reign supreme. To test her knowledge, we asked Turner to look at a series of hairstyles and guess whether they were from Westeros or the runway. \n\nSubscribe to Harper's Bazaar: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoBAZAAR\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar\nhttps://twitter.com/harpersbazaarus\nhttps://www.instagram.com/harpersbazaarus/\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/harpersbazaar/?auto_follow=1"

You have talked before about how Netflix won't be hurt to much by Disney taking it's properties off Netflix. But with the Disney/Fox deal it's safe to assume that a similar thing will happen with all the newly acquired Fox properties. Two major company taking content off Netflix is a lot more significant than if just one did. \n\nMelissa Ramirez  - Looks like the sequel to Alien Covenent got cancelled just like you said it would. But really, is it any surprise? The last film did so badly, why did anyone still think a new one would happen?\n\nJacob Hickey - The box office results of Blade Runner 2019 has to rank amongst the biggest cinematic disappointments of 2017. Such a great movie, such a sad result. Ridley Scott is saying that the reason is did badly was the long running time. Do you agree with him?\n\nDion Debord - Hey John. Hope you’re having a great holiday season! With the debate going on about The Last Jedi, Mark Hamill has repeatedly stated his disappointment with the film. My question is, even if all film is subjective, if Luke Skywalker himself says the movie isn’t good, how can anyone still defend it?\n\nIntothefuture - Q: I have been looking forward to the Han Solo film coming out sometime i’m 2018. I thought with Ron Howard coming in that all would be forgiven and or saved? Do you think this movie has a chance? Reports are saying Disney has no faith. This is not good to hear :("

MQSRmx9zS64,"Space is the final frontier. Being in zero gravity for extended periods of time does some wacky things to the human body. Unless aliens show up and teach us how to deal with these unique challenges, it’s up to scientists to discover ways for the human body to cope.\nSubscribe for more! ► http://bit.ly/BeAmazedSubscribe ◄\nStay updated ► http://bit.ly/BeAmazedFacebook https://twitter.com/BeAmazedVideos https://instagram.com/BeAmazedVideos ◄ \nFor copyright queries or general inquiries please get in touch: beamazedvideos@gmail.com\nCredit: https://pastebin.com/zqUjCLhq\n\nBe Amazed at these Top 10 Things That Happen To Your Body In Space! Muscle Atrophy - Gravity, of course, is what allows you to walk around on the earth with your feet on the ground. In space, your main mode of transportation is floating instead.  Space Eurphoria - The mind is the most important part of the body, so how is it affected by living up in space? Many astronauts have reported that their time in space was a seriously enlightening and perspective changing time of their life. Space Radiation - Luckily for us down here on earth, our atmosphere protects us from cosmic radiation. However, Astronauts outside this atmosphere - out in space - do not have this luxurious blanket, and so they're exposed to ten times more radiation than they would be if they were on earth. Vision problems - If you spend too much time in space, the backs of your eyeballs will flatten just a tiny little bit. This is as bad as it sounds, and it causes your vision to blur. \n\nA Strange Smell - One question that isn’t really explored in many science fiction books or films is what exactly does space smell like? Wouldn’t it just smell like whatever earth smells like? Space Adaption Syndrome - If you go too long without earths’ gravity holding down your body, you could end up with “space sickness”, formally known as space adaption syndrome. Confinement Craziness - If you have a family, a roommate, or have even simply interacted with another human being, you should know that if you put a bunch of people in a confined area for an extended period of time, problems are bound to arise. Your immune system gets worse - Space also takes a toll on your immune system, which you need to protect your body against diseases more than ever in space. You’ll lose bone mass - Here on earth, you maintain your bones thanks to the natural power of gravity and mechanical loading. Osteoblasts, which are cells that regulate the bone matrix, and osteoclasts, which absorb one matrix, continually remodel your bone mass. Your heart weakens - The heart, perhaps the most important muscle you have, is also affected by a lack of gravity. The very size and shape of the human heart is changed by a trip to space."

Learn more about Xfinity Mobile – a new kind of network that combines America’s largest most reliable 4G LTE with the most WiFi hotspots. http://bit.ly/XFINITY_MOBILE\n\nMore Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nWelp, turns out CBS decided not to edit out model Ming Xi (SHEE)’s fall during last night’s airing of the Victoria Secret fashion show. This episode of Newsfeed is brought to you by Xfinity Mobile. It’s a new kind of network.\n\nSooo that’s embarrassing…\n\nRumor was that CBS would probably edit out Ming’s fall on the catwalk at last week’s pre-taped Victoria Secret fashion show…After all, CBS has taken out other awkward flubs at the show in the past, like last year when Ariana Grande got smacked in the face with angel wings. But that was not the case with this tumble.\nYa know why they didn’t cut this out? Because it was TV gold and great publicity. I mean, we’re talking about it right now and so are most media outlets. To amp up the drama further, they sliced in backstage audio from the producers. Check this out…\n\nIt’s truly like a car crash. I don’t want to look, but I have to. My friend and editor at Cosmopolitan, Alex Rees, shares my sentiments, tweeting…”omg and she's crying (tbh its a bit f-ed up to air this part imho but then i recorded the footage to share on twitter so i dont really have a point i guess).”\nIt got even sadder when they show Ming in tears after exiting the runway.\n\nFans have been vocal about their feelings about the final edit of the show on twitter. \n\nOne viewer tweeted, “Pretty uncool of Victoria's Secret to not only show Ming Xi fall, but then also show her crying backstage.”\nAnother viewer was annoyed that they didn’t use footage from the dress rehearsal instead writing, “The vsfs is filmed twice. I’m disgusted that they showed Ming Xi fall, like honestly? Why did they do her like that? They embarrassed her in front of millions of people. I’m so disappointed in Victoria Secret right now.”\n\nUgh, poor, Ming. And if you thought it couldn’t be more embarrassing…the fall happened in front of a hometown crowd in Shanghai. The model wrote this in an Instagram caption following the incident last week. \n\n“It was no doubt one of the hardest moments I have ever had to go through in my career, especially since the show was taking place in my hometown, in front of my mother's and my people's eyes. However, the support I received from everyone yesterday was incredible and I am truly grateful to everyone who was there for me.”\n\nI know they’re supposed to be “angels, but am I horrible for saying I appreciated this humanizing moment. We got to see genuine emotion, a fall… literally and figuritively… and a strong recovery. It’s kind of a hero story for me. What do you think?! Let me know in the comments section below. I’m your host Ashley Iaconetti, thanks for tuning in to Clevver. \n\nNow click left to see Harry Styles get his grove on the Victoria Secret fashion show.

tNla9nyRMmQ,"Hint: single-payer won’t fix America’s health care spending.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nAmericans don't drive up the price by consuming more health care. They don't visit the doctor more than other developed countries:\nhttp://international.commonwealthfund.org/stats/annual_physician_visits/\n\nBut the price we pay for that visit - for a procedure - it costs way more:\nhttp://static1.squarespace.com/static/518a3cfee4b0a77d03a62c98/t/57d3ca9529687f1a257e9e26/1473497751062/2015+Comparative+Price+Report+09.09.16.pdf\n\nThe price you pay for the same procedure, at the same hospital, may vary enormously depending on what kind of health insurance you have in the US.\n\nThat's because of bargaining power. Government programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, can ask for a lower price from health service providers because they have the numbers: the hospital has to comply or else risk losing the business of millions of Americans.\n\nThere are dozens of private health insurance providers in the United States and they each need to bargain for prices with hospitals and doctors. The numbers of people private insurances represent are much less than the government programs. That means a higher price when you go to the doctor or fill a prescription.\n\nUninsured individuals have the least bargaining power. Without any insurance, you will pay the highest price.\n\nFor more health care policy content, check out The Impact, a podcast about the human consequences of policy-making.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-impact/id1294325824?mt=2\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Such shelves are important because they hold back a vast amount of ice. If all such West Antarctic shelves were to collapse and spill the ice into the ocean then global sea level would rise by 10 feet. Beneath the Ross Ice Shelf is one of the least explored bits of ocean on Earth. New Zealand scientists used a hot-water drill hose to create a hole through the thick ice until they reached the perpetually dark water. They hoped to study the health and history of the shelf. Their findings surprised them. They found that the ice in the hole itself and along the base of the shelf was crystalizing and freezing rather than melting. Measurements will be taken for the next few years, to see how the Ross Ice Shelf is changing over time.\n\nRead more in Deep Bore Into Antarctica Finds Freezing Ice, Not Melting as Expected\n\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/ross-ice-shelf-bore-antarctica-freezing/\n\nDeep Bore Into Antarctica Finds Freezing Ice, Not Melting as Expected | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/fyjt5zpNAeg\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo"

Richer than the chemical blues used on most fabrics today, real indigo dye comes from a plant and has a surprising range of qualities: on fabric it is antibacterial, flame resistant and repels odor and dirt. With roots in Japanese culture dating back to the 1600s, indigo-dyed fabrics were worn under the armor of samurais to help keep bacteria from wounds. Today, five farmers keep the tradition of growing indigo alive in Tokushima, Japan. \n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/vR6Acb\n\nThis story is a part of our Frontiers series, where we bring you front and center to the dreamers, pioneers, and innovators leading society at the cutting edge.

1UPJ_Uk9s5c,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday December 12th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, Kristian Harloff, Jared Haibon, Ashley Mova discuss the following:  \n\n1) Hugh Jackman rules out a return as Wolverine if Disney/Fox merger happens; Disney/Fox deal nears finish line as Comcast withdraws\n\n2) ‘Creed 2’ Lands Director Steven Caple Jr.; Stallone Sits Out This Round\n\n3) Opening This Week – Star Wars the Last Jedi \n\n4) Seth Rogen to Go Dramatic as Walter Cronkite in JFK Assassination Film ‘Newsflash’\n\n5) ‘Black Panther’: New International Trailer Released Online \n\n6) Mail Bag \n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nVariety has updated the status of the proposed Disney/Fox merger and is now reporting that the Mouse House has such an inside track on a $60 billion-plus agreement that Comcast has formally exited the deal. While implications for the merger remain foggy, one thing most fans want to see is the Fantastic Four and the X-Men return to the MCU – and especially – if it’s enough to lure Hugh Jackman out of retirement. \n\nVariety reports that MGM and Warner Bros. have hired up-and-coming director Steven Caple Jr. to direct Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson in Creed 2. It was previously reported that Stallone had considered directing sequel at one point, but after talking it over with Jordan and the execs, made the decision to find another director and after a lengthy search, both Jordan and Stallone personally picked Caple to take the reins. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nDeadline reports that Seth Rogen has signed on to play legendary CBS newsman Walter Cronkite in the upcoming drama Newsflash, directed by his Pineapple Express director David Gordon Green. The drama takes place on November 22, 1963, the day of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, unfolding in real time as Cronkite and his producer Don Hewitt attempt to report on one of the biggest news stories in history. \n\nA new international trailer from Japan has landed online for Black Panther and it features even more unseen footage of the advanced weaponry utilized by the people of Wakanda.

Share this Christmas card with someone you love! 💕 ►http://bit.ly/2BUEGVb\nThis project spells out Merry Christmas in 7,000 dominoes and incorporates various Christmas-related objects including ornaments, Santa, a mistletoe, and Christmas lights :)\n\nWatch my other Christmas domino specials here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn0dmj1AovU&list=PLNPDtUHUkSPb-IZVGtuQGkYM5L6aOkevw&index=1\n\nFor a while I've wanted to try building large fancy font freehanded out of dominoes, so I decided to build Merry Christmas in cursive :) I wanted to test my skills in recreating an image out of dominoes by eyeing it. Lettering is always a challenge to build in dominoes based off a picture because you have to be extremely precise to make the font look right (here's the original picture: http://bit.ly/2DylugC). Lots of proportions, measuring, and eye-balling were needed for this project. It was also a challenge to figure out how to get this to topple sequentially by letter, since everything was connected in cursive (however, sometimes not in the direction it needed to topple). I had to tape down a few one way dominoes to ensure that the path would keep going in the right direction. Overall, this was a fun project to do and I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed building it :)\n\nWATCH MORE DOMINO VIDEOS HERE! 😊\n●YOUTUBERS in dominoes ➡️ http://bit.ly/2uRzTDf\n●My BEST domino projects ➡️ http://bit.ly/2swnIWN\n●Video games/movies in dominoes ➡️ http://bit.ly/2u8tZdx\n\nHey!

fbL1ZoAQgUU,"Scientists were surprised and delighted to detect --for the first time--  an interstellar asteroid passing through our solar system. Additional observations brought more surprises: the object is cigar-shaped with a somewhat reddish hue. The asteroid, named ‘Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (400 meters) long and highly-elongated—perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide. That is unlike any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date, and may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.

ywcNsJb2v2U,"Rescue of scared homeless dog, heartbroken and sad, living on the cold streets. This sweet old dog was found roaming near a railroad station. It was too risky to attempt a rescue there, we were worried that he could run and get hit by a passing train, so we followed him, trying to redirect him towards a safer place. It was quite a marathon as he ran away each time we approached him. But he eventually understood we are only trying to help him, or maybe the smell of the yummy treats finally reached his nose. He was limping and we also noticed a scar near his left eye so we took him straight to the veterinary clinic. When we scanned him for a microchip we discovered that he had an owner! We hoped a happy dog-owner reunion would follow, but when we contacted the registered owner he told us he does not want the dog back and asked us to take him. Apparently, Bobi (this is the name given by his owner) ran away from home and traveled quite a long distance, being found approximately 10 miles away from his home. We’ll never know why he left home and why he wasn’t wanted anymore, but we do not want to judge anyone, we’re just thankful that we were able to save him.\nBobi is 9 years old, medium sized, approximately 18 kg (39 lbs), fully vaccinated, microchipped, neutered. His vision is completely lost in the left eye, an old scar located near the eye indicates that he had been injured there, possibly hit, so that’s how he lost his sight in that eye. But the good news is that vision in the right eye is not affected and he sees well with it. \nHe’s very gentle, loving and obedient and he is still playful and curious. It's like he's living now the puppyhood he missed. \nBobi is an old dog in his golden years and he needs a caring adoptive family to offer him a home, a FOREVER home this time, where he can spend his remaining years happy and loved. He is in Howl Of A Dog’s care in Romania, but please note that we also allow international adoptions and he can travel to the USA, Canada or Europe. \nTo adopt Bobi please check our adoption procedure: www.howlofadog.org/adoption-procedure/ or send us an email on contact@howlofadog.org.
